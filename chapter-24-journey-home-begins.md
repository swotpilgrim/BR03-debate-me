# Chapter 24: The Journey Home Begins

The next morning, both teams meet in the hotel lobby for checkout. There's a bittersweet feeling in the air—nationals is over, the tournament we worked toward all year is complete, and now comes the part where we pack up and return to regular life.

I'm standing with my duffel bag and debate case, watching teams say goodbye to competitors from other schools. Promises to stay in touch, exchanges of social media handles, the inevitable "see you next tournament" even though for seniors like me, there may not be a next tournament.

The van is being loaded in the parking lot. Same twelve-passenger vehicle that brought us here, now filled with duffel bags, debate cases, and David's championship trophy secured carefully in back. Both teams worked together to pack everything, the territorial claiming of the trip down replaced by easy collaboration.

Riley appears beside me. "You ready for another six hundred miles in close quarters with Oakridge?"

"I think so." I glance toward where David is helping Professor Caldwell load luggage. "It'll be different than the trip down."

"Because now you're dating the enemy?"

"We're not dating. We had one breakfast together two hours ago."

"A breakfast where you both looked at each other like lovesick puppies, according to Amanda, who saw you in the hotel restaurant."

I feel my face heat. "Amanda has an overactive imagination."

"Amanda has functioning eyes." Riley grins. "How was breakfast?"

"Good. Really good." Better than good, actually. An hour of talking to David about things that had nothing to do with debate—music, books, college plans, summer before freshman year. Getting to know him as a person rather than an opponent. "We're going to keep seeing each other. After we get back."

"Jordan Hayes is going to date David Sterling. I still can't believe this is real."

"Believe it." I am still processing it myself. Two weeks ago, David was my rival and nothing more. Now he's... something else. Something that makes my heart race when he smiles at me.

Coach Brennan calls everyone together. "All right, teams. Same arrangements as the trip down—coaches in front, younger students in middle rows, seniors in back. Let's aim to be on the road in ten minutes."

The van loading is more chaotic than departure—everyone's exhausted from nationals, eager to get home, trading stories about their favorite moments from the tournament. When everything's finally packed and everyone's accounted for, we pile into the van.

David and I end up in the back row again, but this time by unspoken agreement rather than territorial dispute. No one's fighting over seating. Marcus and Riley sit in the row ahead of us, already chatting like friends rather than rival team members.

The van pulls out of the hotel parking lot, heading north toward the highway. DC disappears behind us as we merge into morning traffic, beginning the reverse journey back to Connecticut.

The atmosphere is completely different than the trip down. Then, we were tense, hostile, two rival teams forced together. Now there's easy conversation across school boundaries. Amanda is asking one of the Oakridge sophomores about his debate technique. Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell are discussing tournament organization and judging quality.

And David is sitting beside me in the back row, close enough that our shoulders occasionally brush when the van turns.

"Tired?" he asks quietly.

"Exhausted. You?"

"Same. Didn't sleep much last night." He glances at me. "Kept thinking about everything that happened this weekend."

"The debate?"

"That. And other things." His voice is low enough that only I can hear over the road noise and team chatter. "About what happens when we get back to Connecticut. When nationals is over and we're back to regular school life."

It's the question I've been avoiding thinking about. Here in the van, traveling together, it's easy to exist in this bubble where David and I are something new and undefined. But in a few hours, we'll arrive back at Wellington. Oakridge will drive the final thirty minutes to their school. Both teams will unpack, return to dorms, resume normal schedules.

"We figure it out," I say. "We're both staying in New England for college. We're only thirty minutes apart right now. It's not impossible."

"No. It's not impossible." He shifts slightly closer. "Jordan, I want you to know—I'm serious about this. About us. I'm not going to disappear when nationals ends."

"I know." And I do know. The David Sterling I've gotten to know this past week isn't someone who makes declarations lightly. "I'm serious too."

The van stops at a rest area an hour into the drive. Everyone piles out for bathroom breaks and food. It's the same rest area we stopped at on the way down, when David and I nearly came to blows over who should pay for van snacks.

Now we're standing in line together at the sandwich shop, and Marcus is teasing David about how much things have changed in a week.

"Remember when you two couldn't be in the same space without arguing?" Marcus grins. "And now look at you. It's adorable."

"Shut up, Marcus," David says, but he's smiling.

Riley joins us, ordering a coffee. "It is kind of adorable though. In a weird rivals-to-something-else kind of way."

"You're all terrible," I say, but I'm smiling too.

We eat lunch at outdoor picnic tables, both teams mixed together now. The spring weather is perfect—warm sun, light breeze. Someone suggests taking a team photo, and somehow we end up with Wellington and Oakridge students all crammed together, debate rivals turned friends over the course of one tournament weekend.

Back in the van for the afternoon portion of the drive, the energy starts to mellow. Younger debaters nap, coaches work on laptops, and the back row becomes a quiet space where David and I can talk without the whole van listening.

"What are you thinking?" David asks.

"That this is strange. A week ago we were enemies, and now we're..." I trail off, not sure what word to use.

"More than enemies," he supplies. "Definitely more than rivals."

"But what exactly?"

"I don't know." He glances at me. "Does it need a label right now? Can't it just be... whatever this is?"

I think about it. We're seventeen and eighteen, about to graduate, heading to college in a few months. Trying to define exactly what we are to each other seems premature. But knowing we're something—that matters.

"Whatever this is works for me," I say.

His hand finds mine in the space between our seats, hidden from view of everyone else in the van. His fingers lace through mine, and the simple gesture makes my heart skip.

We ride like that for a while, hands linked where no one can see, both of us looking out the windows as Pennsylvania landscape rolls past. It's comfortable. Easy. The kind of quiet that only works between people who understand each other.

"Jordan?" David's voice is quiet.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being the kind of opponent who made me better. And for being the kind of person I could fall for."

I squeeze his hand. "Thank you for the same thing."

The van crosses into New York, then Connecticut. The familiar landscape of our home state appears outside the windows. We're getting close now—another hour, maybe ninety minutes, until we reach Wellington and this trip is officially over.

"I don't want this to end," I admit quietly.

"The trip?"

"This. Whatever we've been existing in for the past week. Where we're just David and Jordan figuring things out, not prep school students from rival debate teams with complicated histories."

"It doesn't have to end," David says. "We just have to be intentional about continuing it. About making time to see each other, about staying connected even when we're back in our normal routines."

"You make it sound simple."

"Maybe it is simple. Maybe we've been making it complicated because we thought we were supposed to be rivals." He looks at me. "But we're not rivals anymore. We're something better."

The van takes the exit for Wellington. We're fifteen minutes from campus now. The trip is almost over.

As we pull into Wellington's parking lot, both teams start gathering belongings, preparing for the final goodbye. Oakridge will leave from here, driving the last half hour to their school. Wellington students will unpack and head to dorms.

The van stops, and everyone climbs out. Duffel bags are unloaded, debate cases retrieved. Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell shake hands, discussing next season even though half the current teams are graduating.

David and I stand by the van, neither quite ready to say goodbye.

"So," he says.

"So." I try to smile. "Back to normal life."

"With the modification that normal life now includes texting you about things that aren't debate."

"And seeing each other on weekends."

"And figuring out what we are to each other."

"Right. All of that."

He reaches out, takes my hand properly this time where everyone can see. "I'll call you tonight."

"You better."

The Oakridge team is loading back into the van. Marcus calls for David. It's time for them to leave.

"I have to go," David says, but he doesn't move.

"I know."

"Jordan—" He steps closer, and for a moment I think he might kiss me right here in Wellington's parking lot with both teams watching. But instead he just squeezes my hand and says, "This isn't goodbye. This is see you soon."

"See you soon."

He climbs back into the van, and I watch as it pulls out of the parking lot, heading toward Oakridge. David looks back through the window, and I wave.

When the van disappears from view, Riley appears at my side.

"You okay?"

"Yeah." And surprisingly, I am. "I'm good."

We head toward the dorms, and I realize that nationals is over but something else is just beginning. Something that started with rivalry and transformed into understanding and might become something even better.

I lost the debate. But I won something more valuable.

I won David Sterling. And maybe, just maybe, I won myself too.
