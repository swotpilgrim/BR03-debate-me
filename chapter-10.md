# Chapter 10: First Crack

The second day of driving feels different from the first.

Maybe it's because we're all adjusted to the van's rhythms—the slight rattle when we hit highway seams, the way Coach Brennan takes curves, the particular squeak of the middle row seats. Or maybe it's because the teams have stopped pretending we're separate entities trapped in the same vehicle and started acting like what we actually are: twelve debate students heading to the same tournament.

In the middle rows, the conversation flows more naturally than yesterday. Marcus Webb and Marcus Chen have discovered they both follow the same obscure podcast about debate theory and are having an animated discussion about a recent episode. Amanda's showing Christopher Hayes something on her phone—probably tournament brackets. Riley and Liam are debating (of course) about whether Lincoln-Douglas format is superior to parliamentary style.

And in the back row, David Sterling and I sit in our respective window seats, surrounded by companionable silence instead of hostile tension.

I'm reviewing tournament prep materials on my laptop, earbuds in but volume low enough that I'm vaguely aware of the van's ambient noise. David's doing something similar, occasionally making notes on his phone or flipping through printed research.

Every so often, I glance across the middle seat at him. Not consciously, just... awareness. He's focused when he reads, his expression serious and thoughtful. Once, he runs his hand through his hair in what seems like an unconscious gesture, and I notice the way it falls back into place perfectly. Then I immediately refocus on my own work because noticing things about David Sterling's hair is not relevant to nationals preparation.

Around ten-thirty, we pull into the scheduled rest area in Maryland.

"Fifteen-minute break," Coach announces. "Bathrooms, coffee, stretch your legs."

Everyone files out gratefully. Two and a half hours in the van is manageable, but getting out to move around is still a relief.

The rest area is nicer than yesterday's—newer facilities, better landscaping, a Starbucks kiosk instead of just gas station coffee. I head straight for the Starbucks line because the hotel coffee this morning was truly terrible and I need real caffeine.

The line is moderate—a few other travelers, some local workers on break. I'm checking my phone, reading a message from my mom asking how the trip is going, when someone joins the line behind me.

I know it's David without looking. Some sixth sense I've apparently developed.

"Hayes," he says in greeting.

I glance back. "Sterling."

We're still on last-name basis, apparently.

The line moves forward slowly. We stand in silence—not the hostile kind, just normal standing-in-line-for-coffee silence. But it feels weird because it's David Sterling, and until two days ago, standing this close to him would have meant sizing each other up as opponents.

"The coffee at the hotel was bad," David says after a minute.

It's such a normal, mundane observation that I almost smile. "Terrible," I agree. "I'm pretty sure it was brewed yesterday."

"Possibly the day before."

"This place has to be better."

"Low bar," he says, and there's something almost like humor in his voice.

We reach the counter, and David gestures for me to order first. I get a large cold brew because it's getting warmer as we drive south. David orders the same thing, which is either coincidence or we have similar coffee preferences, and I'm not sure which option is weirder.

We end up standing near the pickup counter together, waiting for our drinks.

"Six hours felt longer yesterday," I comment, not sure why I'm making conversation but unable to handle the silence.

"First day in the van," David says. "Everything feels longer the first time."

"Today's been better."

"Less actively hostile?"

I glance at him sharply, but his expression is neutral, maybe slightly amused. He's not mocking—just stating a fact.

"Less actively hostile," I confirm.

Our drinks appear, and we both grab them. We should probably head back to the van now, but neither of us moves immediately.

"Can I ask you something?" David says suddenly.

I'm immediately suspicious. "Depends on the question."

"The topic that's likely to come up in prelims—the federal education policy debate. What's your approach to the funding equity argument?"

Of all the things I expected him to ask, debate strategy wasn't it.

"Why are you asking me?" I counter.

"Because you're good at that particular argument structure. I've seen you deploy it before, and I'm curious how you construct it."

It's weird hearing David Sterling compliment my debate skills. Even weirder is the fact that he's apparently studied my technique enough to know my approach to specific arguments.

"I frame it as both a moral and economic imperative," I say slowly, testing whether he's genuinely interested or setting up some kind of trap. "The moral argument gets judges emotionally invested, but the economic data makes it defensible in cross-examination."

David nods thoughtfully. "That's smart. Leading with moral grounds before bringing in empirics. Most debaters do it backward."

"Most debaters don't think about judge psychology," I say. "They just pile on evidence and hope it sticks."

"Exactly." He takes a sip of his coffee. "I use a similar approach with environmental policy arguments. Establish the ethical framework, then reinforce with data."

And suddenly we're having an actual conversation about debate theory. Not arguing, not competing—just two debaters discussing strategy like colleagues.

"The problem is if you get a judge who's purely empirical," I point out. "They'll see the moral framework as unnecessary pathos."

"True. But those judges are rare at nationals level. Most respond to comprehensive arguments."

"Unless you get Roberts from Vermont. He hates anything that smells like emotional appeal."

David's eyebrows raise. "You've had Roberts?"

"Regionals, junior year. He tanked my score because I opened with a humanitarian angle."

"He did the same thing to me sophomore year," David says, and there's commiseration in his voice. "Wrote 'excessive pathos' on my scorecard."

We're both smiling now, united in shared frustration with a particularly difficult judge. It's surreal.

"Jordan!"

I turn. Riley's walking toward us from the restrooms, Amanda trailing behind her.

"We're heading back to the van," Riley says, then notices David standing next to me. Her eyebrows raise slightly. "Oh. Hey, David."

"Riley," he acknowledges.

"We were just—" I start, then realize I'm not sure how to explain what we were doing. Talking about debate? Like normal people?

"Discussing tournament strategy," David supplies smoothly.

"Right. Strategy." Riley's expression makes it clear she finds this suspicious but interesting.

Marcus Webb appears from the direction of the Starbucks counter, also holding coffee. "Sterling, we're loading up."

"Coming," David says. He glances at me. "See you in the van."

"Yeah. See you."

He heads off with Marcus, and I'm left with Riley and Amanda, who are both staring at me with unconcealed curiosity.

"Don't," I say preemptively.

"I didn't say anything," Riley protests.

"You're thinking it very loudly."

"I'm just observing that you and David Sterling were having what appeared to be a friendly conversation."

"It wasn't friendly. It was professional discussion of debate strategy."

"You were smiling," Amanda adds helpfully.

"I was not—" I stop. Was I smiling? "It was just a normal conversation."

"About debate," Riley says.

"Yes. About debate. Which is a normal thing for debaters to discuss."

"Totally normal," Riley agrees in a tone that suggests she thinks it's anything but normal.

We head back to the van. I climb into my now-familiar seat in the back row, settling in with my coffee and laptop. David arrives a minute later, taking his seat across the aisle.

Our eyes meet briefly. He gives a small nod—acknowledgment, maybe, of the conversation we just had. I nod back.

Then we both return to our prep work, the middle seat still a buffer zone between us, but the hostility that filled this space yesterday notably absent.

The van pulls back onto the highway, and the hours roll by with surprising ease. The teams chat in the middle rows. Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell discuss tournament logistics up front. And in the back, David and I coexist in the kind of silence that doesn't feel like a battle.

Around noon, we stop at the rest area with the food court as planned. Both teams pile out and scatter to various fast food options. I end up in line at a sandwich place at the same time David's ordering from the adjacent pizza counter, and when our eyes meet across the food court, neither of us looks away with hostility.

Just... acknowledgment.

We're all back in the van by twelve-thirty, eating lunch as we drive, making good time toward DC.

"Three more hours," Coach announces. "We're almost there."

The energy in the van shifts—excitement building as we get closer to the tournament. This is what we came for. The road trip was just the means to get here, but nationals is the destination.

I look out my window at the Maryland landscape passing by, then glance across at David. He's looking out his own window, but he must feel my gaze because he turns.

For a second, we just look at each other across the middle seat. Two competitors about to face the biggest tournament of our high school careers. Two captains who've spent two days learning to coexist instead of constantly fighting.

Two people who maybe aren't as different as I thought.

Then the moment passes, and we both look away.

But something's changed. Something shifted in that rest area conversation about debate strategy and difficult judges and the techniques we use to win rounds.

David Sterling is still my rival. We're still going to compete at nationals. One of us is still going to try to beat the other.

But maybe Riley was right yesterday. Maybe rivals don't have to be enemies. Maybe we're just two people who want the same thing and happen to be standing in each other's way.

I'm not sure what to do with that realization.

So for now, I just focus on the miles passing, bringing us closer to DC, and try not to think too hard about why talking to David Sterling about debate felt natural instead of hostile.

Three more hours until we arrive.

Three more hours of this strange, new, not-quite-hostility with David Sterling.

I can handle that.

Probably.
