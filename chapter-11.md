# Chapter 11: Arrival in DC

The Washington, DC skyline appears just after two PM, and the van erupts in cheers.

"Finally!" Amanda shouts from the middle row.

"We made it," Riley says, relief evident. "Actually made it to nationals."

I'm leaning forward, watching the city grow larger. The Capitol dome, the Washington Monument—we're really here. In DC, at the tournament that's been our goal all season.

"Capital Convention Hotel is in the downtown district," Coach Brennan announces, navigating through increasingly dense traffic. "Attached to the convention center where most rounds will be held."

Next to me—across the aisle, technically—David's also leaning forward slightly, watching the city approach. When he catches me looking, neither of us immediately glances away like we would have two days ago.

"Big venue," he comments.

"Huge," I agree. "Coach said they're expecting three hundred teams."

"Three hundred teams, probably five to six hundred competitors." David sounds both excited and daunted. "That's significantly larger than any regional tournament."

"That's nationals."

The van winds through DC streets, passing monuments and museums and tourists snapping photos. The city feels electric—purposeful in a way that matches the nervous energy building in my chest.

We pull up to the Capital Convention Hotel and suddenly it's real. The hotel is massive—at least twenty stories, with the convention center visible through a glass walkway. In front, dozens of students in debate team gear cluster on the sidewalk.

Blazers from every state. Debate cases. School colors. Tournament badges already hung around necks—probably from previous years, worn as talismans.

"This is insane," Liam breathes.

"This is nationals," Coach Brennan says, and there's pride in her voice. "Welcome to the big stage, team."

Finding parking takes another ten minutes because apparently every debate team in America arrived at the same time. Coach finally manages to snag a spot in the hotel garage, and we all tumble out of the van for the last time.

"Freedom," Riley declares, stretching dramatically. "Never sitting in a van again."

"You say that now," Marcus points out, "but we have to drive back after the tournament."

"Don't ruin this moment for me."

We grab our bags and debate cases and make our way toward the hotel entrance. The lobby, when we reach it, is absolute chaos.

Hundreds of students. Maybe thousands. All wearing school gear, all carrying debate materials, all talking at high volume about brackets and judges and rounds. The noise level is overwhelming. Registration tables line one entire wall, with lines snaking across the lobby floor. Tournament officials wear bright yellow staff shirts and look perpetually harassed as they try to direct traffic.

"Stay together," Coach Brennan orders. "We need to check in, get room assignments, and pick up tournament materials. Wellington Hall table—let's find it."

We navigate through the crowd, excusing our way past teams from California and Texas and Florida, schools I recognize from online rankings and debate circuit reputation. The competition level is going to be intense.

The Wellington registration line is mercifully short. Coach handles most of the paperwork while the rest of us wait, craning our necks to take in the scene.

"There's Millbrook Academy," Amanda says, pointing. "They won the Northeast championship."

"And Central High from Illinois," Liam adds. "They've been to nationals three years running."

I scan the crowd, automatically looking for—

Oakridge Prep.

They're at their own registration table about thirty feet away. Professor Caldwell is handling check-in while the Oakridge students stand in a cluster, looking exactly as overwhelmed as we probably do. David's standing slightly apart, observing the lobby with that analytical expression I've come to recognize.

As if sensing my gaze, he looks over. Our eyes meet across the crowded lobby.

He nods slightly. I nod back.

It's such a small gesture, but it feels significant somehow. Acknowledgment that we both made it here, that the road trip is officially over, that the real competition is about to begin.

"Jordan," Coach calls. "I need you to go pick up the tournament packet. Main registration table, give them Wellington Hall and your captain credentials."

"On it." I grab my tournament ID badge—prepared weeks ago and packed carefully in my debate case—and head toward the main registration area.

The line is long, but it moves steadily. I stand behind a girl from Oregon and in front of a guy from Tennessee, both of us silent as we inch forward. The noise of the lobby washes over us—excitement, nervousness, competitive energy crackling through the air.

When I'm about three people from the front, someone joins the line behind me.

"Hayes."

I glance back. David Sterling, also holding his captain credentials, also apparently sent to collect tournament materials.

"Sterling."

"Impressive turnout," he says, gesturing to the lobby.

"Biggest nationals in five years, according to the consortium website."

"Makes getting to finals more impressive."

"If either of us gets there."

David's expression shifts—not quite a smile, but something close. "When we get there."

The confidence in his voice should annoy me. Instead, I find myself almost respecting it.

"Confident," I observe.

"Prepared," he corrects. "There's a difference."

We move forward in line. Two more people until we reach the registration table.

"What do you think the first prelim topic will be?" David asks.

And suddenly we're in another debate discussion, like at the rest stop, except now we're standing in the nationals venue surrounded by hundreds of competitors.

"Either education policy or environmental regulation," I say. "Those were the two topics flagged as likely in the consortium briefing."

"Environmental regulation would favor West Coast teams," David muses. "They've been running climate arguments all season. Education policy is more neutral."

"Which means they'll probably lead with education to level the field."

"Smart tactical thinking."

We reach the front of the line together—there are multiple registration staff, so we both step up simultaneously to adjacent positions.

I give my credentials to the staff member, a tired-looking college student wearing a yellow shirt that says TOURNAMENT VOLUNTEER. She checks her computer, nods, and hands me a thick packet.

"Wellington Hall. You're all set. Preliminary brackets will be posted at five PM tonight. Welcome ceremony at seven in the Grand Ballroom. Good luck."

"Thank you."

David's receiving the same information from his registration volunteer. We step away from the table at the same time, both clutching our tournament packets.

Around us, the lobby continues to buzz with energy. Teams everywhere, all preparing for the same competition.

"Three hundred teams," David says, looking around. "And only one wins nationals."

"Probably going to be Wellington," I say.

His eyebrow raises. "Oakridge has won three of the last five years."

"Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."

"But it suggests a pattern of excellence."

"Or luck."

Now he definitely almost-smiles. "If you think nationals wins are luck, you haven't been paying attention."

"I've been paying very close attention," I say, and we both know I'm not just talking about tournament statistics. I've been studying David Sterling specifically, analyzing his debate style, learning his patterns.

The way he's been doing with me, apparently, based on his comments about my argument strategies.

"I know," David says quietly. "I've noticed."

There's a strange tension in the moment—acknowledgment of our mutual obsession with beating each other, but without the hostility that usually accompanies it.

"Jordan!" Riley's voice cuts through the lobby noise. I turn and see her waving from where our team is clustered near the elevators.

"I should go," I say to David.

"Yeah. Team stuff." He hesitates, then adds, "See you at the welcome ceremony."

"See you."

I head back to Wellington's group, and David returns to Oakridge's. As I walk away, I'm hyperaware that we just had an entire conversation—multiple conversations over the past few hours, actually—without a single argument. We discussed debate strategy, tournament structure, competitive odds. Like colleagues. Like people who respect each other's abilities.

When did that happen?

"Got the packet?" Coach asks when I reach the team.

I hand it over. "Registration said brackets post at five, welcome ceremony at seven."

"Perfect. That gives everyone time to settle in and do prelim prep." Coach distributes room keys. "Riley, Jordan, Amanda—you're in 1247. Everyone unpack, rest for an hour, then we'll meet in my room at four to review strategy."

The elevator ride to the twelfth floor is packed with debate students from at least four different schools. Everyone's buzzing with pre-tournament energy, discussing brackets and predictions and which judges they hope to avoid.

Room 1247 is standard hotel—two double beds, desk, window overlooking the DC skyline. Riley and Amanda immediately claim one bed, so I take the other.

I unpack methodically: laptop on desk, chargers plugged in, tournament materials organized, clothes hung in closet. Everything has its place. Control through organization.

"You okay?" Riley asks, watching me from her bed.

"Fine. Why?"

"You've been quiet since we checked in."

"Just focusing. We're at nationals. It's time to get serious."

"You've been serious for two months," Riley points out. "Maybe relax for five minutes?"

But I can't relax. We're here. At nationals. The tournament I've been visualizing for months. The stage where I'll finally prove I'm as good as David Sterling—better than David Sterling.

Except the weird thing is, after two days in a van with him, after conversations about coffee and judges and debate strategy, he feels less like an enemy and more like... what? A rival, yes. Competition, definitely. But not an enemy.

I don't know what to do with that shift.

So I do what I always do when I'm uncertain—I focus on what I can control. Tournament prep. Strategy. Making sure Wellington is ready for prelims.

"I'm going to review the packet," I tell Riley, settling at the desk with my laptop.

Riley exchanges a look with Amanda, but neither of them argues. They know me well enough to recognize when I need to work through something by working.

I open the tournament packet and start reading. Preliminary round structure. Judging criteria. Time schedules. All the details that will govern the next three days.

Somewhere in this hotel, probably twelve floors up or down, David Sterling is doing the same thing. Preparing for prelims, reviewing strategy, getting ready to compete.

Tomorrow, we might face each other in a round. Or we might be on completely different bracket paths. But either way, we're both here, both ready, both determined to win.

Two years of rivalry brought us to this moment.

Two days of forced proximity changed something I'm not ready to name.

And now three days of nationals will determine which of us is actually the best.

I stare at the tournament schedule, and my hands are steady.

This is what I came for.

Let the competition begin.
