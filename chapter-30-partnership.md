# Chapter 30: Partnership

Two weeks after nationals, I'm sitting in Wellington's library with three textbooks open, a half-finished practice exam, and a growing headache. Finals week is brutal.

My phone buzzes. I reach for it, grateful for any distraction from AP calculus.

David: *I'm outside. Come take a break.*

I blink at the message. David's supposed to be at Oakridge studying for his own finals. We've been texting constantly since nationals ended—good morning messages, late-night conversations, random thoughts throughout the day—but I wasn't expecting to see him until this weekend.

Me: *You're here? At Wellington?*

David: *Front entrance. I brought coffee.*

I pack up my laptop and notes, shoving everything into my backpack. Around me, other Wellington students are deep in study mode—headphones on, energy drinks scattered across tables.

But I'm walking out of the library with a smile on my face, because David Sterling drove thirty minutes just to bring me coffee.

He's waiting at the campus entrance, leaning against his car with two coffee cups and that slight smile that I've learned means he's genuinely happy. He's wearing jeans and an Oakridge hoodie, looking more relaxed than I've ever seen him at tournaments.

"Hey," I say, walking up to him.

"Hey yourself." He hands me one of the coffee cups. "Vanilla latte, extra shot, no sugar. I remembered."

"You drove all the way here to bring me coffee?"

"I drove all the way here to see you. The coffee was just an excuse." He grins. "Also, I was procrastinating on studying for my European history final and decided you'd be better company than Napoleon."

"I don't know. Napoleon was pretty interesting."

"Not as interesting as you."

We start walking toward town, falling into step naturally. It's a warm afternoon, spring fully established—flowers blooming everywhere, trees green and full, students scattered across the quad.

"How are finals going?" David asks.

"Brutal. I've written approximately forty essays in the past week, and I have three more exams before graduation."

"Same. Except add in a physics lab practical that I'm ninety percent sure I failed."

"You? Failing something?" I look at him in mock shock. "David Sterling, perfect student and debate champion, admitting imperfection?"

"I'm learning to be okay with not being perfect at everything." He glances at me. "Someone very smart recently told me that failure isn't disaster."

"She sounds wise."

"She is. Also argumentative and brilliant and makes me want to be better while making me feel like I'm already enough."

My chest does something warm and complicated. "You're getting pretty good at the romantic declarations."

"I've been practicing." He squeezes my hand. "How much time do you have before you need to get back to studying?"

"An hour. Maybe two if I skip dinner."

"Don't skip dinner. But let's make the most of an hour."

We walk to the coffee shop in town—the same place we've gone three times in the past two weeks, already establishing it as "our spot." It's busy with college students and locals, but we find a table by the window.

David sits across from me, and for a moment we just look at each other. Two weeks ago we were in a hotel figuring out if this could be real. Now we're here, navigating what it means to date someone from a rival school while juggling finals and college preparation.

"What are you thinking?" David asks.

"That this is strange. Being here with you like this. Not at a tournament, not competing, just... existing together."

"Good strange or bad strange?"

"Good strange. Really good strange." I sip my coffee. "I keep expecting someone to tell us we're doing it wrong. That rivals aren't supposed to transform into whatever we are now."

"We're doing it exactly right." He leans forward. "Jordan, can I tell you something?"

"Always."

"I was terrified two weeks ago. When nationals ended and we had to figure out what this looks like in real life. I thought maybe the road trip was just... proximity and adrenaline and once we were back to normal, it would fade."

"But it didn't."

"It got stronger. Every text message, every phone call, every time I drive here to see you—it confirms that what I feel isn't about debate or competition or forced proximity. It's about you."

I reach across the table, finding his hand. "I feel the same way. I thought dating you would be complicated and difficult. And it is complicated—the distance, the schedules, all of it. But you make it feel worth it."

"That's all I want. To be worth the effort."

"You are. You absolutely are."

We sit there for a moment, holding hands across the table, processing how far we've come. From rivals who couldn't stand each other, to people figuring out what partnership looks like.

"So," David says. "College. We've been avoiding talking about it."

"Because it's terrifying."

"Or because it's exciting." He grins. "Jordan. We're both going to be in Boston. That's twenty minutes by subway, thirty if there's traffic. We'll see each other more in college than we do now."

"If we make it to college without imploding from finals stress."

"We'll make it. We're both too stubborn to fail." He pauses. "What are you thinking about for summer? Before freshman year starts?"

"Honestly? I haven't let myself think that far ahead. I've been so focused on finals and graduation that everything after that feels abstract."

"Think about it now. With me."

I take a breath, letting myself actually consider it. "I'm working at the town library. Saving money for textbooks. Probably doing orientation at BU in July."

"I'm doing Harvard orientation in August. And working with my dad's law firm, which will be tedious but looks good on a resume." He squeezes my hand. "But I want to see you. Between all of that. Actually spend time together when we're not stressed about tournaments or finals."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Real dates. Not just stolen hours between study sessions. Actually getting to know each other outside of debate and academic pressure."

The thought makes me smile. "That sounds perfect."

"Good. Because I have plans."

"What kind of plans?"

"The kind where I take you to actual nice restaurants. Where we see movies and argue about them afterward. Where we explore Boston together before freshman year starts. Where we figure out who we are as Jordan and David, not Wellington versus Oakridge."

"I like those plans."

"Me too."

We finish our coffee, and David checks his phone. "I should head back to Oakridge. I have that physics exam tomorrow."

"You're not going to fail."

"I might. And I'm learning to be okay with that." He stands up, pulling me with him. "Walk me back to my car?"

We head back toward Wellington's campus, taking our time. Around us, the town continues its normal rhythm—locals walking dogs, college students heading to dinner, spring afternoon fading.

When we reach his car, David turns to face me.

"Jordan Hayes," he says, and there's something in his voice that makes me pay attention. "I want you to know something."

"What?"

"Having someone who matches your intensity, who pushes you and supports you equally, who sees your capabilities and respects them instead of being intimidated—that's what partnership should be. And that's what you are to me."

My breath catches. "You're that for me too. You've always been that for me, I just didn't let myself see it when we were rivals."

"We were idiots."

"Complete idiots." I step closer. "But we figured it out eventually."

He cups my cheek with one hand, thumb brushing across my skin. "I'm really glad we figured it out."

"Me too."

He kisses me there in Wellington's parking lot, and it's easier each time—learning the rhythm of each other, the way we fit together, the certainty that this is real and good and worth navigating complications for.

When we pull apart, I'm smiling. He's smiling.

"Text me when you get back to Oakridge," I say.

"I will. And Jordan?"

"Yeah?"

"When you're stressing about finals at two in the morning, text me. I'll probably be awake stressing too. We can stress together."

"That's the most romantic thing you've ever said to me."

"I know. I'm getting good at this relationship thing."

He climbs into his car, and I step back to watch him drive away. But instead of feeling sad like I did two weeks ago, I just feel... content. Happy. Excited about seeing him again this weekend. Excited about summer and college and everything that comes next.

My phone buzzes before he's out of the parking lot.

David: *Already missing you. This is becoming a pattern.*

Me: *Good pattern. Better than trying to beat each other at tournaments.*

David: *Debatable. I enjoyed beating you.*

Me: *You enjoyed TRYING to beat me.*

David: *See? This is what I mean. You challenge everything. It's perfect.*

I'm grinning as I walk back to the library. Riley's waiting at our usual table, and she looks up when I approach.

"David?" she asks.

"Yeah. He brought coffee."

"That's disgustingly sweet." But she's smiling. "You two are nauseatingly cute together."

"I know."

"You deserve it, though. You deserve someone who sees how amazing you are."

I sit down and pull out my calculus textbook. Finals still need studying for, exams still need taking, and graduation is three weeks away. Life continues its normal complicated rhythm.

But now there's David in it. Texting me encouragement when I'm stressed. Driving thirty minutes just to bring me coffee. Making plans for summer and college and everything beyond high school debate.

Two years ago, David Sterling was my rival. The opponent I needed to beat to prove myself. The person who represented everything I was trying to overcome.

But somewhere along the way—maybe that first tournament sophomore year, maybe the road trip to nationals, maybe the moment in the hotel hallway when he asked permission to kiss me—he transformed into something better.

Into my equal. My partner. The person who challenges me to be better while making me feel like who I am is already enough.

And sitting here in Wellington's library with calculus homework and a half-finished latte and a text message from David saying he believes in me, I realize something important.

I didn't lose the national championship. But I won something infinitely more valuable.

I won partnership with someone who sees me completely and respects me anyway. Someone who matches my intensity and challenges my thinking. Someone who makes me want to be better while celebrating who I already am.

Turns out the fiercest rival makes the best partner.

And Jordan Hayes and David Sterling, former opponents, are about to be unstoppable.

Not because we're competing against each other anymore.

But because we're finally on the same team.

**THE END**
