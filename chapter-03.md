# Chapter 3: Nationals Announcement

Morning assembly at Wellington Hall is one of those traditions that feels simultaneously archaic and essential. The entire student body crammed into the assembly hall, wearing blazers even though it's only eight o'clock, listening to announcements about everything from sports schedules to community service opportunities to reminders that the library is not, in fact, an appropriate place for skateboarding.

I usually tune out most of it, using the time to mentally review debate prep or plan my day. But today, something makes me pay attention when Headmaster Chen steps to the podium after the usual announcements are finished.

"I have particularly exciting news for our debate community," he says, and my entire body goes still.

Riley, sitting next to me, elbows me gently. She knows what's coming. The debate team has been waiting for this announcement for weeks.

"The New England Debate Consortium has finalized the location for this year's national championship tournament," Headmaster Chen continues. "I'm pleased to announce that nationals will be held in Washington, DC, at the Capital Convention Center, in six weeks' time."

The assembly hall erupts in applause—not just from the debate team, but from the entire school. Wellington Hall hasn't sent a team to nationals in three years. The fact that we've qualified this year is a big deal.

I'm clapping too, but my mind is already racing ahead. Six weeks. Washington, DC. The biggest stage in high school debate. The culmination of everything I've worked toward since freshman year.

This is it. This is my chance.

"Congratulations to Coach Brennan and our debate team for qualifying," Headmaster Chen says, nodding toward where our team sits scattered throughout the assembly hall. "You'll be representing Wellington Hall on a national stage. Make us proud."

The moment assembly is dismissed, I'm on my feet and heading for the debate practice room. I fire off a group text as I walk: *Emergency team meeting. Practice room. Now.*

By the time I arrive, Riley is right behind me, and the others are trickling in—Amanda looking excited and nervous, our two sophomores, Marcus Chen (no relation to the headmaster) and Liam Park, practically vibrating with energy.

"Okay," I say, once everyone's settled around the practice table. "Six weeks. That's forty-two days to prepare for the most important tournament of our lives."

"Our lives?" Liam repeats, grinning. "Jordan, I'm a sophomore. I have at least two more years of this."

"You should still treat it like it's your only shot," I say. "Because that's the mindset we need. Every practice, every drill, every research session—we approach it like we won't get another chance."

Riley, ever the voice of reason, opens her laptop. "Let's start with logistics. We need to figure out travel arrangements, hotel bookings, registration deadlines—"

"Coach Brennan is handling that," I interrupt. "Our job is preparation. Strategy. Making sure we're ready for the level of competition we're going to face."

Amanda raises her hand slightly, like we're in class rather than a team meeting. "What is the competition level at nationals? I mean, I've only been doing debate for a year. I've never competed at anything beyond regionals."

It's a fair question. Amanda joined the team as a junior, later than most of us, but she's shown real promise. She's smart, quick on her feet, and genuinely passionate about argumentation. But nationals is a different beast than regional tournaments.

"The competition is intense," I tell her. "Teams from every state, all the best debaters in the country. You'll face opponents who've been training year-round, who have coaches that specialize in specific argument styles, who've been doing this since middle school."

I watch Amanda's face shift from excitement to apprehension.

"But," I add, "we're good too. We wouldn't have qualified if we weren't. And we have six weeks to get even better."

"What about Oakridge?" Marcus asks. "Are they going to be there?"

The question I knew was coming. The question I've been thinking about since Headmaster Chen's announcement.

"Yes," I say. "Oakridge qualified. They'll be there."

"Which means David Sterling," Liam says, with the kind of reverence that makes me irrationally annoyed.

"David Sterling is just another debater," I say, more sharply than I intend. "Yes, he's good. Yes, Oakridge has a strong program. But they're not unbeatable. We've proven that."

Riley gives me a look that clearly says *have we, though?* Because the truth is, Wellington hasn't beaten Oakridge in a major tournament final in two years. I've beaten David in individual rounds, but when it comes to the championships that matter, Oakridge has the edge.

That's going to change at nationals.

"So what's the plan?" Riley asks, steering us back on track.

I pull out my notebook—I've been sketching preparation strategies since last night—and start outlining. "We need to intensify our practice schedule. I'm thinking six days a week, three hours minimum. We rotate focus: one day on case construction, one day on rebuttals, one day on cross-examination technique."

"That's a lot," Marcus points out.

"Nationals is a lot," I counter. "If we want to compete with the best, we have to train like the best."

We spend the next hour mapping out our preparation schedule. Riley takes notes on her laptop, organizing everything into a shared document. We divide research responsibilities—everyone taking specific topic areas to build comprehensive briefs. We set goals for practice rounds, analysis sessions, video review.

By the time we're done, we have a detailed six-week plan that would make a military strategist proud.

"This is ambitious," Amanda says, looking at the schedule Riley's projected on the practice room screen. "But I think we can do it."

"We can definitely do it," I say. "We're going to nationals. We're going to compete at the highest level. And we're going to prove that Wellington Hall belongs on that stage."

The team nods, energy building. This is what I love about debate—the way you can take individual passion and channel it into collective purpose. We're not just six students anymore. We're a team with a shared goal.

After the meeting breaks up, everyone heading to classes or the library to start on research assignments, I stay in the practice room. Riley lingers too, like I knew she would.

"You okay?" she asks.

"I'm great. This is what we've been working toward."

"I know. But you've got that look."

"What look?"

"The look you get when you're planning how to destroy David Sterling."

I should probably deny it, but Riley knows me too well. "I've been waiting two years for a chance to beat him on a stage that actually matters. Regionals are one thing. But nationals? That's everything."

"Jordan." Riley sits on the edge of the practice table, studying me. "What happens if we get to nationals and you don't face David? What if Wellington and Oakridge are on different bracket paths? What if one of you gets eliminated before you can compete head-to-head?"

The thought has occurred to me. The thought has, in fact, kept me up at night more than once.

"Then I'll focus on winning nationals," I say. "Because that's the goal. Not just beating David Sterling. Winning the whole thing."

"But beating David is part of it," Riley says, not a question.

"It's a significant part," I admit. "He's been the standard I measure myself against for two years. Every tournament, every round, I've been trying to be better than him. If I get to nationals and never face him, never get that definitive proof that I'm as good as he is..." I trail off, not sure how to finish that sentence.

"You'll always wonder," Riley supplies.

"Yeah."

She's quiet for a moment. Then: "You know what I think? I think whether you face David Sterling or not, you're going to be incredible at nationals. You're one of the best debaters in New England, Jordan. You don't need him to validate that."

"I know," I say, even though part of me isn't sure I believe it.

Riley hops off the table and grabs her bag. "Come on. We have calc in fifteen minutes, and if we're late again, Mr. Patterson is going to assign extra homework."

I follow her out of the practice room, but my mind is still on nationals. On Washington, DC. On the convention center where hundreds of debaters will compete for the title.

And on the very real possibility that somewhere in those rounds, I'll face David Sterling one more time.

Later that night, after dinner and homework and a brief practice session with Amanda on cross-examination technique, I'm back in my room. The nationals announcement has been posted on the debate consortium website, complete with tournament structure, schedule, and registration information.

I print it out and pin it above my desk, right next to my tournament calendar and my list of strategic goals.

*National Debate Championship
Capital Convention Center, Washington, DC
Six weeks from today*

I sit at my desk and close my eyes, visualizing the tournament. The convention center ballroom. The judges' table. The podium where I'll stand, representing Wellington Hall.

And across from me, at the opposing podium, David Sterling.

In my visualization, I'm delivering the final rebuttal. My arguments are airtight, my logic flawless. I've anticipated every counter-argument, addressed every weakness, built a case so strong that even David Sterling can't find a crack in it.

When the judges announce the decision, it's Wellington Hall.

It's me.

I open my eyes and look at the announcement pinned to my wall. Six weeks isn't a lot of time. But it's enough.

It has to be enough.

I pull out my laptop and open a new document: *Nationals Preparation—Week One*. I start typing, outlining research priorities and practice focuses and strategic goals. The work is methodical and precise, the kind of detailed planning that's always helped me feel in control.

Because I am in control. I've spent three years at Wellington Hall proving that hard work and strategic thinking can overcome any advantage. I've proven that a scholarship student from a public-school background can compete with legacy students who've had every opportunity.

Now I'm going to prove it on the national stage.

And if that means defeating David Sterling in the process—if that means finally, definitively showing that I'm just as good as the legendary Sterling debate dynasty—then that's exactly what I'll do.

Six weeks.

Let the preparation begin.
