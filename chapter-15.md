# Chapter 15: Teams Notice

I wake up before my alarm again, mind already spinning through semifinal strategy. Today's the day—top sixteen competing for eight spots in finals. Win today, and I'm one round away from the national championship.

Riley and Amanda are still asleep when I slip out of bed and head to the shower. By six-thirty, I'm dressed and reviewing notes at the desk, laptop open, tournament materials spread around me in organized chaos.

My phone buzzes with the notification I've been waiting for: *Semifinal brackets posted.*

I pull up the tournament website immediately. My semifinal is at nine AM against a team from Oregon. Tough competition—they won their preliminary rounds decisively. But I'm ready.

I scan the rest of the bracket automatically, looking for—

David Sterling. Semifinal at ten-thirty against a team from North Carolina.

We're on opposite sides of the bracket again. If we both win semifinals, we'll face each other in finals this afternoon.

The thought makes my stomach flip in a way that's not entirely about competition.

"Brackets posted?" Riley's voice comes from the other bed, groggy with sleep.

"Just came through. I've got Oregon at nine."

"And let me guess—you already checked David's bracket?"

I don't answer, which is answer enough.

Riley sits up, fully awake now despite the early hour. "Jordan. We need to talk."

"About semifinals strategy? Because I was thinking—"

"About David Sterling."

"There's nothing to talk about."

"There's everything to talk about," Riley counters. "You've been acting weird for days. Ever since the road trip started, actually. And yesterday after prelims when you disappeared for an hour? You ran into him, didn't you?"

"We talked briefly. It was nothing."

"Jordan." Riley gets out of bed and sits at the desk chair, facing me directly. "I'm your best friend. I've known you for three years. I know when something's different. And something is very different with how you're acting around David Sterling."

I close my laptop, recognizing that Riley's not going to let this go. "Fine. Yes, we've talked a few times. Yes, the road trip changed some things. But it's still competition. We're still rivals."

"Rivals who have deep conversations about family pressure and expectations?"

"How did you—"

"You told me last night, remember? Over dinner? When you were all distracted and kept spacing out?"

I'd forgotten that conversation. Or maybe I'd tried to forget it.

"It was one conversation," I say defensively. "About tournament stress. Two competitors relating to similar pressure. That's normal."

"It would be normal if it were anyone else," Riley says carefully. "But this is David Sterling. The person you've spent two years actively hating. Suddenly you're having heartfelt moments in hotel hallways? Jordan, that's not nothing."

"It's not hate anymore," I admit. "Maybe it never really was. Maybe it was just... intense competitive focus that looked like hostility."

"And now?"

"Now it's still intense competitive focus. But also..." I trail off, not sure how to finish.

"Also you're starting to like him," Riley supplies.

"I don't—" I start to protest, then stop. Because maybe she's right. Maybe the feeling I've been refusing to examine for days is exactly that. "I respect him as a competitor."

"You respect him as more than a competitor."

"Riley—"

"You watch him compete when you should be preparing for your own rounds. You light up when you're discussing debate strategy with him. Yesterday when you came back from talking with him, you looked happy. Not tournament-success happy. Different happy."

"That's ridiculous."

"Is it?" Riley leans forward. "Look, I'm not saying you're in love with the guy. But I am saying that something shifted. And you need to figure out what that something is before you face him in finals—if you both make finals—because competing against someone you have complicated feelings about is going to mess with your focus."

She's not wrong. The thought of facing David in a championship round used to fill me with pure competitive fire. Now it's complicated by all these other feelings I don't want to name.

"What am I supposed to do about it?" I ask, hearing the frustration in my own voice. "I can't just turn off whatever this is. And I can't not compete if we both advance. That's the whole point of nationals."

"I'm not saying don't compete," Riley says. "I'm saying acknowledge what's happening so it doesn't blindside you. You and David Sterling have some kind of connection now—whether it's friendship or respect or something else. That's okay. But you need to know where your head is before you step into that round."

Amanda stirs in the other bed, waking up. "Are we having a serious pre-dawn conversation about Jordan's feelings for David Sterling? Because I'm here for that."

"We're not—I don't have—" I sputter.

"You absolutely do," Amanda says, sitting up. "We've all noticed. The entire team's been talking about it."

My face flushes. "The entire team?"

"You and David have been making eyes at each other for days," Amanda continues cheerfully. "It's actually kind of adorable. Very enemies-to-lovers."

"We're not enemies or lovers. We're competitors."

"Competitors who look at each other like you're solving some complex equation that only the two of you understand," Riley adds.

"That's just debate discussion!"

"Sure it is," they say in unison.

I bury my face in my hands. "This is a disaster. I have semifinals in three hours, and you two are convinced I'm having some kind of romantic crisis with David Sterling."

"Not romantic," Riley says. "Yet. But definitely moving in that direction."

"I need coffee," I declare, standing up. "And breakfast. And for this conversation to end."

"The conversation might end," Riley says, "but the feelings won't."

She's annoyingly right.

At seven-thirty, both Wellington and Oakridge teams meet for breakfast in the hotel restaurant. It's becoming routine now—both schools mixing at tables, the artificial divide completely gone. But today there's extra energy because everyone made semifinals.

I'm sitting with Riley and Amanda when Marcus Webb and Christopher Hayes join our table, and David takes a seat two chairs down from me.

"Big day," Marcus Webb says. "Semifinals. Eight spots left in finals."

"Four from each bracket," David adds. "If the competition's as tough as prelims, it's going to be close rounds."

"You nervous?" Amanda asks him.

"Always," David admits, which surprises me with its honesty. "Semifinals at nationals? Anyone who's not nervous isn't paying attention."

"Same," I find myself saying. "My opponent from Oregon has an eighty-nine percent win rate this season."

"Your opponent from North Carolina has an ninety-two percent rate," David counters. "So we're both facing tough competition."

"Best competition," I correct. "That's what semifinals are supposed to be."

Our eyes meet, and there's that connection again—the one Riley was talking about. Understanding, mutual respect, something deeper than just rivalry.

Marcus Webb is watching this exchange with poorly concealed amusement. He leans over to David and says something low that I can't hear. David's expression shifts to annoyance.

"Not now," David tells Marcus.

"I'm just saying—"

"Marcus. Drop it."

Riley's watching this interaction with the same knowing look she gave me earlier. Across the table, she catches Marcus Webb's eye, and they exchange a glance that clearly communicates: *They're both hopeless.*

I focus intently on my eggs, willing this breakfast to end.

After eating, teams disperse to prepare. I'm heading toward the elevator when Riley pulls me aside.

"For the record," she says quietly, "I think David Sterling is good for you. You're sharper when you're around him, more engaged. And I think he feels the same way about you. Whatever that means for after nationals, I don't know. But right now? Just compete. Do your best. And if you both make finals, deal with the complicated feelings then."

"There are no complicated feelings."

"Jordan."

"Fine. Maybe slightly complicated feelings. But I'm not dealing with them until after I win nationals."

"That's my competitive overachiever," Riley says, grinning. "Go destroy semifinals."

I head to my room to do final prep, but I can't stop thinking about what Riley said. About connections and feelings and the way David and I have been orbiting each other all week.

She's right that something changed. I just don't know what to do about it.

My phone buzzes with a text. Unknown number.

*Good luck in semifinals. Beat Oregon. I want to face you in finals. - Sterling*

I stare at the message, warmth flooding my chest. He wants to face me. Not wants to avoid me or hopes we're on different brackets. He wants to compete against me specifically.

I text back: *Same. Beat North Carolina. See you in finals.*

His response comes immediately: *Deal.*

I smile at my phone like an idiot, then catch myself and put it away. Focus. Semifinals. I can process whatever this thing with David is after I win my round.

At eight-thirty, I head down to the tournament space. My round is in Conference Room 4A, and when I arrive, my opponent from Oregon is already there, looking confident and prepared.

The judges file in. The round begins.

And for ninety minutes, everything else disappears except debate—arguments, rebuttals, strategy, the intellectual battle I've spent years perfecting.

When the judges announce Wellington Hall, the victory feels earned and significant.

One more round. Finals. This afternoon.

I exit the conference room, and my phone immediately buzzes with messages.

Riley: *Tell me you won*

I respond: *Won. Finals this afternoon.*

Riley: *KNEW IT. Now we wait to see if David makes it through.*

I shouldn't care whether David wins his semifinal. I should just focus on preparing for finals regardless of opponent.

But I'm checking my phone obsessively for the next hour, waiting for bracket updates.

At eleven forty-five, the notification finally comes: *Finals bracket posted.*

I pull it up with shaking hands.

Jordan Hayes, Wellington Hall vs. David Sterling, Oakridge Prep.

Finals. This afternoon. The two of us.

Everything we've both worked for, everything this rivalry has been building toward for two years, comes down to one round.

I should feel pure competitive fire.

Instead, I feel excitement mixed with something more complicated—anticipation, nervousness, and the strange awareness that facing David in finals isn't just about winning anymore.

It's about proving something to him. To myself. To whatever this connection between us has become.

My phone buzzes with another text from David: *Finals. You and me. 2 PM. Let's settle this.*

I text back: *See you there.*

And despite everything—the pressure, the stakes, the complicated feelings I'm trying to ignore—I smile.

Because if I'm going to compete for the national championship, there's no one I'd rather face than David Sterling.
