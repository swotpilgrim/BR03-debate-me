# Chapter 20: The Decision

The rebuttal phase is where championships are won or lost.

I have five minutes to dismantle David's case while defending my own, to synthesize everything that happened in this debate and explain why the affirmative position stands stronger. Five minutes to prove I deserve to be national champion.

I step up to my microphone, notes spread in front of me, but I'm not just reading prepared responses. I'm thinking, analyzing, responding to what actually happened in this round.

"Throughout this debate, my opponent has raised legitimate concerns about sanction implementation challenges." I make eye contact with the judges. "But these challenges don't invalidate the fundamental effectiveness of sanctions as a foreign policy tool. They highlight the need for strategic deployment and humanitarian safeguards."

I systematically address David's main contentions. His argument about regime change? I counter that behavior modification is the more appropriate metric, and by that standard, sanctions show measurable success. His concerns about civilian harm? I acknowledge the real risks while demonstrating how properly targeted sanctions with humanitarian exemptions mitigate those harms. His claim that sanctions strengthen authoritarian regimes? I flip it, showing how sanctions create internal pressure by restricting resources available to those regimes.

But I'm not just defending. I'm rebuilding my case, showing how even accounting for David's strongest objections, the affirmative framework holds. I cite my evidence about South Africa, about Iran, about the documented cases where sanctions achieved concrete diplomatic objectives without military intervention.

The words flow with a clarity I've never quite achieved before. I'm not just reciting arguments—I'm genuinely engaged with the ideas, with the complexity of the debate David and I just had. Every point I make builds on the intellectual exchange we've been having for the last forty-five minutes.

When my five minutes are up, I step back from the microphone. My heart is pounding, my hands are shaking slightly, and I feel both exhausted and more alive than I've ever felt in a debate round.

The applause is substantial. Riley is beaming from the front row. Coach Brennan nods with quiet approval.

But what I notice most is David across from me, watching with an expression I can't quite read. Not hostile. Not even competitive anymore. Something else. Something that makes my chest tighten.

"Mr. Sterling, your final rebuttal."

This is David's last chance to speak. He has the advantage of going last, of being able to respond to everything I just said without me having a counter. In debate, the last word is powerful.

David steps up to his microphone one final time. He pauses, making eye contact with each judge, and then begins.

"My opponent has demonstrated exactly why this debate matters." His voice is measured, confident. "She's articulated a sophisticated defense of sanctions as foreign policy tools. And that sophistication itself reveals the fundamental problem with the affirmative position."

He's not dismissing my arguments. He's using them.

"The fact that sanctions require such careful targeting, such extensive humanitarian safeguards, such precise strategic deployment to avoid causing harm—this demonstrates that sanctions are inherently problematic tools that demand near-perfect implementation to avoid devastating consequences. And in the real world of international relations, we don't get perfect implementation."

It's brilliant. He's taking my own acknowledgment of implementation challenges and making it the center of his case. Not contradicting what I said, but reframing it to support the negative position.

He continues, systematically showing why even granting the validity of my arguments, the negative framework better accounts for real-world complexities. He acknowledges the South Africa example but explains why that case was exceptional rather than representative. He accepts that sanctions created pressure on Iran but demonstrates how that pressure came at enormous human cost that could have been avoided with different diplomatic approaches.

His final minute is devastating—not because he's attacking me, but because he's demonstrating a level of strategic thinking that matches mine completely. We've pushed each other to this level of performance, and the result is a debate that transcends simple point-scoring to become genuine intellectual engagement with complex ideas.

When David finishes his rebuttal and steps back from the microphone, the ballroom erupts in applause louder than any I've heard today. People are standing, clapping enthusiastically, and I find myself clapping too—for David, for the debate we just had, for what we accomplished together.

The tournament director returns to the microphone. "Thank you to both debaters for an exceptional round. That was truly outstanding debate at the highest level." He looks toward the judges' table. "Judges, you may now deliberate. We'll take a brief recess while they reach a decision."

The ballroom immediately fills with noise—teams discussing what they just witnessed, coaches analyzing arguments, spectators sharing opinions on who won. But David and I both remain at our podiums, breathing hard, processing what just happened.

I should be reviewing my performance, analyzing where I was strong or weak, worrying about the judges' decision. Instead, I'm looking at David across the twenty feet separating us.

He's looking back.

There's so much in that look. Recognition of what we just did. Acknowledgment that regardless of who wins, that debate was extraordinary. Maybe something else too, something I'm not ready to name but can feel building between us.

Marcus appears at David's side, saying something enthusiastic, probably congratulating him on the rebuttal. Riley materializes next to me. "Jordan. That was incredible. You were amazing."

"Thanks," I manage. "So was he."

"Yeah." Riley follows my gaze to David. "Yeah, he really was."

The judges are huddled at their table, looking at their scorecards, discussing in low voices we can't hear. My stomach is doing flip-flops. This is it. After all the preparation, all the work, all the years of competing—the decision is being made right now by five people I've never met before this weekend.

I should feel pure anxiety. I should be desperate to know if I won or lost. And part of me is anxious, part of me desperately wants to have won nationals, to prove I belong at Wellington, to validate every sacrifice I've made for debate.

But another part of me—a growing part—feels strangely at peace. Because that debate was the best round of my life. I competed at my absolute highest level. I was challenged and pushed by an opponent who saw every strategy I deployed and met me at every turn. Win or lose, I just experienced what elite competition feels like when it's about excellence rather than just victory.

The minutes drag on. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Fifteen. The judges are taking their time, which probably means it's close. Riley keeps glancing at me nervously. Coach Brennan remains calmly seated, but I can see the tension in her shoulders.

Finally—after what feels like an eternity but is probably only twenty minutes—the judges finish their deliberation. The head judge hands a paper to the tournament director, and he steps back up to the microphone.

"If everyone could please take their seats. The judges have reached a decision."

The ballroom goes completely silent. You could hear a pin drop.

David and I both straighten at our podiums. Our eyes meet one more time, just briefly, before we both turn our attention to the tournament director.

"First, I want to acknowledge that this was one of the closest finals in the history of this tournament." The director looks down at the paper in his hand. "The judges' scores were separated by the narrowest possible margin. Both debaters demonstrated exceptional skill, sophisticated argumentation, and the highest standards of competitive debate."

Get on with it, I think. Just tell us who won.

"The judges' decision, by the closest margin in nationals finals history..." He pauses, and I want to scream. "Is awarded to David Sterling and Oakridge Preparatory Academy."

The ballroom explodes. Oakridge's section erupts in cheers and applause. Marcus is yelling, Professor Caldwell is standing, the entire Oakridge team is on their feet celebrating. The sound is overwhelming, echoing off the ballroom walls.

David Sterling won nationals.

I lost.

I should be devastated. This was my goal, my obsession, my last chance to prove I deserve to be at Wellington. I wanted this championship more than I've wanted anything in my academic career. And I lost. By the closest margin in history, but I still lost.

But I'm not devastated.

I'm standing at my podium, breathing hard, and what I feel is... exhilaration. The debate we just had was incredible. The way David pushed me, challenged me, met every argument I made with equally sophisticated responses—that was what competition is supposed to feel like. Not crushing your opponent, but both competitors operating at their absolute best and seeing who can reach just slightly higher.

Riley is at my side, her hand on my arm. "Jordan? Are you okay?"

I look at her, and I must have a strange expression on my face because she looks confused. "I'm okay," I say, and I mean it. "I'm actually okay."

Across the ballroom, David is surrounded by his team. Marcus has him in a headlock in celebration. Professor Caldwell is shaking his hand with dignified pride. The championship trophy is being brought forward, and David will hold it, will have his photo taken with it, will take home the hardware that represents being the best high school debater in the country.

And I'm genuinely happy for him.

As the celebration continues around him, David looks up, searching the room until his eyes find mine. We're twenty feet apart, surrounded by our respective teams, separated by the judges' table and the designation of winner and runner-up.

But in that moment, I swear he knows what I'm feeling. I can see it in his face—he's relieved, yes, and proud of winning, but there's something else too. A recognition that winning by the narrowest margin against someone who pushed him to be his absolute best matters more than an easy victory ever could.

The tournament director is calling us both forward for the presentation of awards. David will receive the championship trophy. I'll receive the finalist medal. We'll shake hands and pose for official photos, playing our parts in the formal conclusion of the tournament.

But as I walk toward the center of the ballroom, all I can think is that losing to David Sterling—losing to someone who saw every capability I have and respected them fully, who challenged me to be better than I've ever been, who made that debate the best round of my life—doesn't feel like losing at all.

It feels like I finally found the right opponent.

And maybe, just maybe, something more than an opponent.
