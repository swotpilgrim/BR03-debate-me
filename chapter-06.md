# Chapter 6: Road Trip Begins

The alarm goes off at five AM, dragging me from a sleep that was barely restful. I'd spent half the night staring at the ceiling, mind racing through worst-case scenarios for the next three days. Now those scenarios are about to become reality.

I dress in comfortable clothes—jeans, Wellington hoodie, sneakers—and grab the duffel bag I packed last night. Debate case. Laptop. Tournament prep materials. Everything I need for nationals, plus the uncomfortable reality that I'll be sharing a van with Oakridge Prep for the next twelve hours.

Riley's waiting outside my dorm room when I emerge, looking equally tired and apprehensive.

"Ready for this?" she asks.

"Absolutely not."

"Same."

We head across campus in the pre-dawn darkness. The parking lot behind the administrative building is lit by overhead lights, and I can see the rental van already waiting—a large white twelve-passenger vehicle that looks both too big and too small for what we're about to do.

Coach Brennan is already there, talking with someone I don't recognize. Probably the rental company representative. Amanda, Marcus, and Liam arrive within minutes of us, all looking nervous and excited in equal measure.

"Okay team," Coach Brennan says, gathering us together. "Quick review before Oakridge arrives. We're representing Wellington Hall for the next three days. That means professionalism, respect, and maturity. I know there's competitive history between our schools, but we're going to rise above that. Understood?"

We all nod. I notice Coach looking particularly at me when she says it.

"Good. Help me load the van."

We spend the next fifteen minutes stowing gear in the back—duffel bags, debate cases, a cooler with snacks and drinks, Coach Brennan's tournament materials. The van has four rows of seats: driver and passenger up front, then three rows of bench seats that each fit two to three people.

At six-fifteen, headlights appear at the parking lot entrance.

My stomach drops.

A sleek black SUV pulls in, followed by a sedan—Oakridge's transportation to get their team here. Both vehicles park near our van, and I watch as the Oakridge Prep debate team climbs out.

I recognize them all from tournaments: Professor Caldwell, distinguished and formal even at six in the morning. Marcus Webb, their second-in-command, who's always seemed friendly in a way that's slightly at odds with Oakridge's usual intensity. Christopher Hayes and two other students whose names I don't remember.

And David Sterling.

He's wearing dark jeans and an Oakridge Prep hoodie, his debate case slung over one shoulder, and even at this hour he looks completely composed. His eyes scan our group and land on me for just a second—a flicker of recognition, maybe acknowledgment—before he looks away.

"Professor Caldwell," Coach Brennan says warmly, extending her hand. "Good to see you."

"Patricia," he responds with equal formality. "Thank you for hosting the departure point."

They shake hands like colleagues at a conference, not coaches whose teams are about to spend three days in uncomfortable proximity. I'm simultaneously impressed and annoyed by their professionalism.

"Teams," Coach Brennan announces. "Let's make introductions."

This is surreal. We've competed against Oakridge for years, faced them in dozens of rounds, but we've never been formally introduced like we're at some kind of debate social event.

Professor Caldwell introduces his students, and Coach Brennan does the same for us. When it's my turn, I step forward slightly.

"Jordan Hayes, captain," I say, keeping my voice neutral and professional.

David's turn comes immediately after. "David Sterling, captain."

Our eyes meet. His expression is unreadable—not hostile, not friendly, just carefully blank. I match it with my own carefully controlled neutrality.

"Excellent," Coach Brennan says, clearly determined to maintain the positive atmosphere. "Now, let's establish some ground rules for the trip."

She and Professor Caldwell take turns outlining expectations: mutual respect, no antagonistic behavior, cooperation on logistics like rest stops and meals. It's all very reasonable and mature, and I hate every second of it because it means we can't just ignore Oakridge exists.

"Regarding seating," Professor Caldwell says. "Perhaps we should allow the students to arrange themselves as they see fit?"

I see Riley exchange a glance with Marcus Webb. There's something calculating in both their expressions that makes me immediately suspicious.

The Oakridge students start loading their gear into the van's storage area. Our two teams move around each other with excessive politeness, lots of "excuse me" and "after you" that feels performative and weird.

When it's time to actually board the van, there's an awkward moment where everyone hesitates.

Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell claim the front seats—Coach driving, Professor in passenger seat. That leaves three rows for twelve students.

The middle two rows fill first: Amanda and one of the Oakridge students in the second row, Marcus Chen from Wellington and Marcus Webb from Oakridge in the third row—I notice they're already talking, which seems like a betrayal somehow. Liam and Christopher Hayes take the remaining middle seats.

Which leaves the back row.

Riley and I head toward it at the same time David Sterling and his teammate do. We all pause, recognizing the territorial implications.

"You take it," I say to the Oakridge students, already turning toward the middle rows to squeeze in somewhere else.

"No, please," David says, his voice polite but impersonal. "We're fine in the middle."

"The back row has more leg room," Riley points out helpfully. "Might be good for the captains who'll need to review tournament prep."

I shoot her a look that clearly communicates *what are you doing*, but she just smiles innocently.

"Riley's right," Marcus Webb says from his seat. "Cap tains should be comfortable. You two take the back."

"You two" meaning David and me.

The other Oakridge teammate has already claimed a middle seat. Riley is steering me toward the back with a hand on my shoulder. Within thirty seconds, through what I'm certain is coordinated manipulation, David Sterling and I end up in the back row.

There are three seats across. I take the window seat on the left side. David takes the window seat on the right side. The middle seat becomes a buffer zone of empty space.

Riley plops down in the row in front of us and turns around, grinning. "See? Plenty of room for everyone."

I'm going to kill her later.

Coach Brennan does a final head count, confirms everyone's buckled in, and starts the engine.

"Washington, DC, here we come," she announces.

The van pulls out of the parking lot and onto the main road. Through my window, I watch Wellington Hall's campus disappear behind us. The sky is starting to lighten with early morning sun, and the roads are mostly empty.

I pull out my phone and headphones, determined to spend this trip exactly as I planned: ignoring David Sterling's existence.

Across the aisle, separated by three feet and a middle seat, David does the same thing. Headphones in, attention on his phone, posture carefully angled away from me.

The first hour passes in silence.

Not comfortable silence—hostile silence. The kind where you're hyperaware of the other person's presence even though you're pretending they don't exist. Every time David shifts position, I notice. Every time I adjust my headphones, I'm aware he might notice.

In front of us, Riley has struck up a conversation with Marcus Webb about some debate tournament from last year. Behind us—or ahead of us, technically—the other students are gradually warming up to each other. I hear scattered conversations about schools, about debate topics, about nationals.

But in the back row, David Sterling and I maintain our cold war.

I stare out the window at the Connecticut landscape rolling past. Trees starting to bloom with spring green. Towns waking up. Highway signs promising we're making progress south.

This is going to be the longest trip of my life.

My phone buzzes with a text from Riley: *You two look ridiculous*

I glance forward. Riley's watching me in the reflection of her phone screen, clearly amused.

*Not engaging* I text back.

*Proud of your restraint*

*It's only been an hour*

*Baby steps*

I resist the urge to lean forward and smack her.

Around seven-thirty, someone in the middle rows asks about breakfast plans. Coach Brennan suggests we'll stop at a rest area in about an hour once we cross into New York.

"There's a decent food court," Professor Caldwell adds. "Should have options for everyone."

The conversation about food breaks some of the ice. Students start sharing snack offerings—someone passes around a bag of pretzels, someone else has a container of cookies their mom packed. The atmosphere gradually shifts from tense to merely awkward.

But in the back row, nothing changes.

I chance a glance across the aisle. David's staring out his window, his expression unreadable in profile. His debate case is at his feet, probably full of the same kind of meticulous tournament prep I have in mine. His Oakridge hoodie looks expensive and perfectly fitted, because of course it does.

He must feel me looking because his eyes flick toward me for just a second. Our gazes meet.

Neither of us smiles. Neither of us nods. We just acknowledge that yes, we're both here, both trapped in this situation, both determined to get through it with minimal interaction.

Then we both look away.

Two more hours until the first rest stop.

Eleven more hours until we reach DC.

Three days until nationals actually begins and I can stop thinking about David Sterling as my traveling companion and start thinking about him as my opponent.

I can survive this.

I have to.

I close my eyes and try to doze, but I'm too aware of everything—the rumble of the van's engine, the conversations happening around me, the presence of David Sterling three feet away.

When I open my eyes again, Riley's turned around in her seat, watching me with a mixture of sympathy and amusement.

"Doing okay?" she mouths.

I give her a thumbs up that we both know is a lie.

She grins and turns back around.

Outside my window, the Connecticut state line passes, and we enter New York. One state down. Several more to go.

I settle in for what promises to be the most uncomfortable road trip of my life.
