# Chapter 9: Breakfast Planning

The hotel breakfast buffet is exactly what you'd expect—waffles, scrambled eggs, cereal dispensers, coffee that's been sitting since five AM. But after yesterday's marathon drive, it looks good enough.

I arrive at six-forty-five, having woken before my alarm. The breakfast area is already busy with business travelers, families, and truckers loading up on coffee.

Riley and Amanda appear shortly after, both looking more awake than I feel.

"Dibs on waffles," Amanda announces, heading straight for the waffle maker.

I grab a plate and build something resembling a balanced breakfast: scrambled eggs, fruit that's definitely from a can, toast. The coffee is predictably terrible, but it's caffeine, so I pour a large cup anyway.

The Wellington students naturally cluster at two tables near the window. I sit with Riley and Amanda, and Marcus and Liam join us with plates piled high with questionable sausage.

"Morning," Marcus says through a mouthful of waffle. "Everyone sleep okay?"

"As well as you can in a hotel bed," Riley responds. "Better than the van, at least."

The Oakridge students trickle in over the next ten minutes. I track their arrival peripherally while pretending to focus on my eggs. Marcus Webb and Christopher Hayes grab food and take a table across the room. Two other Oakridge students I still don't know well sit at a nearby table.

David Sterling arrives last, looking annoyingly put-together for this hour. He heads straight for coffee, then settles on toast and fruit before scanning for seating.

For a second, his eyes land on our table. I deliberately don't make eye contact.

He joins his team, and the two groups maintain separate territories like yesterday.

But then Coach Brennan arrives with Professor Caldwell, and they don't separate.

Instead, they grab food together, chatting easily, and sit at a table right between the Wellington and Oakridge groups. They're talking about something—probably tournament logistics—but they look like colleagues, maybe even friends. It's strange seeing them interact like this after years of watching them coach rival teams.

"That's weird, right?" Riley murmurs, nodding toward the coaches.

"Very weird," I agree.

"They probably know each other from debate circuit events," Amanda says. "Coaches talk."

"I know they talk. It's just weird seeing it."

What's even weirder is the realization that if Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell can be civil—friendly, even—then my rivalry with David Sterling is starting to feel more personal than institutional. The schools aren't enemies. The coaches aren't enemies. It's just me and David carrying this hostile dynamic.

That's an uncomfortable thought.

I'm finishing my coffee when Coach Brennan approaches our table.

"Jordan, I need you and David to finalize today's route," she says. "We have some options for rest stops and lunch, and you two should coordinate which makes the most sense."

"Can't you and Professor Caldwell just decide?" I ask.

"We could," Coach says with a slight smile. "But you're captains. Time to practice leadership decisions together."

The word "together" feels loaded. This is another test of whether David and I can function like adults.

"Fine," I say, standing and grabbing my plate.

"Sterling!" Coach Brennan calls across the breakfast area. "Route planning. Now."

David looks up from his table, sees me standing with Coach, and nods. He says something to Marcus Webb, then stands and walks over.

We all reconvene at a corner table that Coach has already commandeered. She has a paper map spread out—actual paper, not phone GPS—marked with our route and various stop options.

"You're six hours from DC," Coach says, pointing to our location in Pennsylvania. "You need at least one rest stop, probably two. There's also the question of lunch—fast food somewhere, or pack sandwiches and eat on the go."

"On the go would be faster," I say immediately.

"On the go would also mean six hours in the van with minimal breaks," David counters. "That's not ideal for anyone's sanity."

I want to argue reflexively, but I catch Coach's expression—she's watching us like this is a test. Which it obviously is.

"You're both right," Coach says diplomatically. "So figure out which approach makes more sense given time constraints and team needs."

She stands and returns to Professor Caldwell's table, leaving David and me alone with the map.

There's a beat of awkward silence.

"Okay," I finally say. "Let's look at the actual route."

I pull the map closer. David does the same from his side of the table. We're both leaning over it now, studying the marked highway path from our Pennsylvania hotel to Washington, DC.

"If we leave at seven-thirty like we planned, we hit this rest area around ten," David says, pointing to a marked stop in Maryland. "That's reasonable for a bathroom break. Then if we push through to around noon-thirty, there's this area with restaurant options for lunch."

I trace the route with my finger. "But if we stop for lunch—sit-down restaurant, ordering, waiting for food—we're looking at an hour minimum. That puts us in DC around two instead of one."

"And arriving at one versus two matters why?"

"Because we're already behind on prep time," I say. "We lost a day to travel. Every hour counts."

"We didn't lose a day. Travel is part of the process." David's tone is patient in a way that's slightly annoying. "Rushing into DC exhausted and hungry doesn't optimize prep time. It just makes everyone less effective."

He has a point, but admitting that feels like conceding ground in our ongoing battle.

I study the map more carefully, looking for compromise. There's a rest area around noon that has fast food options—not sit-down restaurants, but not just vending machines either.

"What about this spot," I say, tapping the location. "It's got a food court. Quick service, variety of options, we can be in and out in thirty minutes."

David leans in to look, close enough that I'm aware of his proximity. He smells like coffee and hotel soap, and I immediately push that observation away because it's irrelevant.

"That works," he says, surprising me by agreeing immediately. "Fast food quality might be questionable, but it's efficient."

"So rest stop at ten, lunch at noon, arrival in DC around one-thirty. Compromise."

"Compromise," David agrees.

We look at each other across the map for a moment. This is the second time we've successfully coordinated logistics without fighting. It's disorienting in a way I don't want to examine too closely.

"I'll update the schedule," I say, pulling out my phone.

"I'll let my team know."

We both stand, the planning session apparently concluded. But instead of immediately walking away, David hesitates.

"The coaches are right," he says finally. "About cooperation being possible. Between the schools, I mean."

"They're coaches," I point out. "They're not competing directly. It's different for them."

"Is it?" He's looking at me with an expression I can't quite read. "They've been coaching rival programs for years, but they can still be professional. Maybe even friends. That doesn't diminish their competitive drive."

"What's your point?"

"My point is maybe the rivalry doesn't have to be hostile. Maybe we're just... competitors who want the same thing."

It's the most direct conversation we've had about our dynamic, and I'm not sure how to respond. Part of me wants to argue that yes, the rivalry does have to be hostile, because that's how it's been for two years. But another part—the part that's exhausted from a day and a half of maintaining constant antagonism—wonders if he's right.

"Maybe," I concede carefully.

David nods, looking almost relieved that I didn't immediately disagree.

"Travel day two," he says, shifting back to safer territory. "Think we'll survive it?"

"We survived day one. Barely."

"The snack incident was..." he trails off, like he's searching for the right word.

"Ridiculous," I supply.

"I was going to say 'unfortunate,' but ridiculous is more accurate."

There's something almost like humor in his voice, and I find myself almost smiling before I catch myself.

"We should probably not have any more snack-related arguments," I say.

"Agreed. New rule: all snack purchases are pre-approved by both captains to avoid territorial disputes."

He's definitely joking now, and I'm definitely almost smiling, and this is weird. David Sterling and I are joking. About our argument. While planning logistics like functional humans.

"I'm going back to my table," I say, needing to extract myself from whatever this moment is.

"Right. I'll post the route update."

I return to Riley and Amanda, who are both watching me with entirely too much interest.

"That looked civil," Riley observes.

"We're coordinating logistics. It's supposed to be civil."

"Yeah, but you guys managed civil. That's progress."

"It's not progress, it's basic functionality."

"Twenty-four hours ago you were screaming about chips in a parking lot," Amanda reminds me. "This is definitely progress."

I don't have a good counter-argument to that, so I just focus on finishing my terrible coffee.

Across the breakfast area, David's returned to his table and is showing Marcus Webb something on his phone—probably the updated route. Marcus glances up at me, grins, and gives David a shove. David looks annoyed but also like he's suppressing a smile.

I look away quickly, uncomfortable with whatever dynamic I just witnessed.

At seven-fifteen, both teams clear breakfast plates and head back to rooms for final packing.

"Last leg," Riley says as we walk to room 307. "Six more hours and we're in DC."

"Six more hours in that van."

"Six more hours with David Sterling."

"Thanks for the reminder."

"You managed breakfast planning without casualties. Maybe it won't be so bad."

"Riley. It's six hours. With David Sterling. It's going to be bad."

But as I pack my duffel bag, I'm aware that "bad" doesn't quite feel accurate anymore. Not good, certainly. Still awkward.

But maybe not actively hostile.

Maybe just complicated.

At seven-twenty-eight, both teams reconvene in the parking lot. The van is already loaded with luggage. Coach Brennan does a final head count while Professor Caldwell confirms the route on his phone.

"All right, team," Coach announces. "Final push to DC. Let's make it a good drive."

We file into the van in what's becoming routine—coaches up front, younger students in the middle rows, captains in the back.

I take my window seat on the left. David takes his window seat on the right. The middle seat remains the neutral zone.

But today, when I put my headphones in and look out the window, I'm not actively avoiding David's existence.

I'm just... coexisting with it.

Small progress.

Very small.

But progress nonetheless.
