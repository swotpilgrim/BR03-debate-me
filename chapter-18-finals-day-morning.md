# Chapter 18: Finals Day Morning

I wake to Riley shaking my shoulder. "Jordan. Wake up. It's nine-thirty."

I got maybe three hours of sleep. My body feels like it's moving through water, but my brain won't stop racing—replaying last night's conversation with David, panicking about finals in less than five hours.

"I'm up," I mumble. Amanda is already dressed, organizing debate materials with her usual enthusiastic energy.

"Big day!" she chirps. "Championship finals! It's like watching two legends battle!"

I manage a weak smile. "Thanks, Amanda."

Riley watches me with sharp eyes as I stumble toward the bathroom. She knows something is different.

The shower helps wake me up. I spend longer than necessary under the hot water, trying to clear my head. Today is finals. Today I need to focus on debate strategy, not midnight conversations or vulnerable confessions.

When I emerge from the bathroom, Riley is sitting on her bed with her arms crossed. "So. Want to tell me why you look like you got zero sleep?"

"Nerves," I say, pulling on jeans and a Wellington t-shirt. I'll change into formal attire later, but for now I need comfortable. "Finals anxiety."

"Uh huh." Riley doesn't sound convinced. "And it has nothing to do with a certain Oakridge captain?"

I freeze while brushing my hair. "What are you talking about?"

"Jordan. I woke up at one-thirty and you weren't here. Your bed was empty."

My stomach drops. "I couldn't sleep. I went to the lobby to review notes."

"Alone?"

"Riley—"

"Did something happen with David Sterling?"

Amanda has gone very quiet, suddenly intensely interested in her materials.

I sit down on my bed. "I ran into him in the lobby. We both couldn't sleep. We... talked."

"Talked." Riley's eyebrows rise. "For how long?"

"A couple hours."

"A couple hours." She exchanges a look with Amanda. "And what exactly were you talking about with your biggest rival the night before you're supposed to destroy him?"

"We weren't—" I stop, trying to figure out how to explain. "We were talking about debate. And pressure. And why we both care so much about winning. It wasn't—it was just talking."

"Just talking," Riley repeats. "Jordan, you're aware that you've spent two years despising David Sterling, right? And now you're having two-hour heart-to-hearts with him in hotel lobbies?"

"I don't despise him. He was my rival. That's different."

"Was?" Riley catches the past tense. "What changed?"

Everything changed. The road trip, the conversations, the way he understood my scholarship anxiety. The way talking to him felt easier than it should.

"Nothing changed," I say, but we both know I'm lying. "We just got to know each other as people. That's all."

Riley studies my face. "Are you going to be able to compete against him today? Because if your head's not in the game—"

"My head is in the game." I stand up. "I'm going to debate my absolute best. Nothing about last night changes that."

"If you say so." But Riley's expression suggests she has doubts.

We head down to breakfast at ten, meeting the rest of the Wellington team in the hotel restaurant. The breakfast buffet is chaos—teams from all over the country grabbing food before various finals rounds begin. I spot the Oakridge table across the room and deliberately choose seats with our backs to them.

Coach Brennan joins us with a plate of fruit and coffee. "How's everyone feeling this morning?"

"Excited!" Amanda says immediately.

"Nervous," admits one of our younger debaters.

Coach Brennan looks at me. "Jordan?"

"Ready," I say, because that's what I'm supposed to say. That's what captains say on finals morning.

She nods, but her eyes linger on my face a moment longer than necessary. Coach Brennan has known me for four years. She can tell when I'm off.

I pick at scrambled eggs and force myself to eat toast, but my appetite is nonexistent. Across the restaurant, I can hear Marcus's distinctive laugh from the Oakridge table. I wonder if David is sitting there, if he's eating breakfast, if he slept any better than I did.

I wonder if he's thinking about last night too, or if he's managed to compartmentalize it into "pre-competition conversation" and move on.

"Jordan?" Riley nudges me. "Coach is talking to you."

I snap back to attention. "Sorry, what?"

Coach Brennan repeats herself with patient understanding. "I asked if you wanted to do a final prep session before lunch. We have the conference room reserved from eleven to noon."

"Yes. Definitely. That would be good."

After breakfast, Riley follows me to the bathroom.

"Okay," she says. "What's actually going on?"

"Riley—"

"You talked to him for two hours and now you can barely focus. Tell me the truth. What happened?"

I lean against the sink. I look tired, stressed, completely unprepared for the emotional minefield today has become.

"We talked about why we compete. About the pressure we both feel. About validation and family expectations." I meet her eyes. "Riley, he gets it. He understands in ways no one else does."

"So you bonded with your rival over shared anxiety." Riley's tone is gentler. "That's sweet. And also terrible timing."

"I know. But I can't unknow him now. I can't go back to just seeing him as an opponent. He's a person struggling with the same stuff I am, and we're about to debate for a national championship."

"Can you still compete at your best against him? Or is this going to mess with your head?"

I think about it. "I think it might actually make me better. Because now I'm competing against someone I respect, someone who will see every argument and appreciate the strategy. Someone who will push me to be my absolute best."

Riley considers this. "That's either really mature or you're rationalizing because you have feelings for him."

"I don't have feelings for him."

"Jordan." Riley gives me a look. "Those are feelings."

My stomach flips. "Even if that were true—it doesn't matter. Today is about debate. Feelings can wait."

"Can they though?" But Riley doesn't push further. "Okay. Let's go to the prep session."

The prep session from eleven to noon should help, but I find my concentration slipping. Coach Brennan walks me through potential argument structures and rebuttal strategies. Amanda asks smart questions about cross-examination techniques. The other team members take notes and discuss various scenarios.

I participate, I contribute, I say all the right things. But part of my brain is elsewhere.

"Jordan." Coach Brennan's voice cuts through my distraction. "Can I talk to you privately for a moment?"

We step into the hallway outside the conference room. Coach Brennan looks at me with the expression she uses when she's about to say something I don't want to hear but need to.

"What's going on with you today?"

"Nothing. I'm fine. Just pre-competition nerves."

"I've coached you for four years. I know what your pre-competition nerves look like. This is something else." She pauses. "Does it have to do with David Sterling?"

How does everyone know? Am I that obvious?

"We talked last night," I admit. "In the lobby. We were both too anxious to sleep. And we... talked about the pressure we're both under. It got kind of personal."

Coach Brennan nods slowly. "And now you're worried that seeing him as a person rather than just an opponent will affect your performance."

"Maybe. I don't know." I run my hand through my hair. "Coach, I've spent two years building this rivalry in my head. David Sterling was the benchmark, the goal, the person I had to beat to prove myself. And now he's just... David. A seventeen-year-old kid who's terrified of disappointing his family. How do I compete against that?"

"The same way you always have," Coach Brennan says simply. "With intelligence, passion, and respect for your opponent. Jordan, recognizing your opponent's humanity doesn't weaken you. If anything, it shows maturity. You can compete fiercely and still acknowledge that the person across from you is doing the same thing."

"But what if—" I stop, not sure how to articulate the fear. "What if I lose because I care too much about him as a person?"

"Or," Coach Brennan counters gently, "what if you compete at your absolute best because you respect him enough to give him your full effort? Because that's what he deserves from you."

I let that sink in. She's right. David deserves my best performance, not some watered-down version where I'm holding back because I'm confused about my feelings.

"Finals are at two PM," Coach Brennan says. "You have three hours to get your head straight. Use them wisely."

The rest of the morning passes in a blur. I change into my formal debate attire—black dress pants, crisp white blouse, Wellington blazer. I review my notes one more time, going over argument frameworks and potential counterarguments. I eat a light lunch even though my stomach is in knots.

At 1:30, the Wellington team gathers in the lobby to walk over to the ballroom together. Everyone is in formal attire now, looking professional and polished. Riley stands beside me, a steady presence.

"You've got this," she says quietly.

"I know." And I do know. I've prepared for this moment all year. I'm ready for this debate.

I'm just not sure I'm ready for everything that comes after.

We walk toward the ballroom, and I catch a glimpse of the Oakridge team heading in the same direction from another hallway. David is in a dark suit and tie, looking every inch the prep school champion. Our eyes meet for half a second across the crowded convention center corridor.

There's no time for words, no opportunity for acknowledgment. Just that brief moment of connection before we're swept forward with our respective teams toward the ballroom doors.

Finals begin in thirty minutes.

I take a deep breath, square my shoulders, and follow my team inside. Whatever happens in the next two hours—whether I win or lose, whether David and I walk away as rivals or something else—I'm going to give this debate everything I have.

Because that's what we both deserve. And because anything less would be an insult to what we've both worked so hard to achieve.

The ballroom doors close behind me, and there's no going back now.
