# Chapter 12: Tournament Preparation

By four o'clock, Wellington's team is crammed into Coach Brennan's hotel room for strategy. The room feels small with six students, one coach, and the palpable nervous energy of impending competition.

"Brackets post in one hour," Coach says, pulling up the tournament website. "Welcome ceremony at seven. First prelim rounds tomorrow at eight AM. Tonight, we focus on preparation—not panic."

"Who's panicking?" Marcus asks, leg bouncing.

"You are," Riley observes.

Coach walks us through tournament structure: three preliminary rounds tomorrow, two the day after, then semifinals and finals Sunday. Only the top sixteen teams advance to semis. Out of three hundred teams, sixteen. The math is brutal.

"We didn't come here to stress about odds," Coach says firmly. "We came here to compete. So let's talk strategy."

We spend the next ninety minutes drilling potential topics, reviewing argument structures, discussing judge psychology. It's intense and focused, and I'm in my element—analyzing, strategizing, preparing for every possible scenario.

But I keep checking my phone.

At first, I tell myself I'm monitoring the time. Then I tell myself I'm checking for important tournament emails. But Riley catches me glancing at my phone for the fifth time in twenty minutes and gives me a knowing look.

"Waiting for something?" she asks innocently.

"Bracket postings," I say, which is true but not the whole truth.

"Mm-hmm."

At five o'clock exactly, my phone buzzes with the notification I've been waiting for: *National Tournament brackets now available.*

Everyone in the room immediately grabs their phones. The next sixty seconds are silent except for typing and the occasional sharp intake of breath as people find their preliminary assignments.

"I've got Thompson from Wisconsin in my first round," Amanda says, sounding nervous. "She won her state championship."

"You've prepared for this," Coach reminds her. "Trust your training."

I pull up the bracket and scan for Wellington assignments. My first round is tomorrow at eight-thirty, second round at eleven, third round at two. Opponents listed next to each slot.

Then, because I apparently have no self-control, I search for Oakridge Prep's bracket.

David's first round is at nine. Second at noon. Third at three.

Our preliminary schedules are completely different. We won't face each other unless we both make semifinals.

I'm surprised by the small twist of disappointment in my chest.

"Okay team," Coach says, closing her laptop. "We have two hours until welcome ceremony. I want everyone to rest, hydrate, eat something light. Don't drain yourselves before the tournament even starts."

We file back to our rooms. Riley, Amanda, and I order room service—pasta because carbs are good brain fuel—and eat while reviewing notes in comfortable silence.

At six-thirty, we change into formal attire for the welcome ceremony. Wellington blazers, dress pants, the uniform that marks us as serious competitors. I check my reflection in the bathroom mirror—blazer pressed, hair neat, tournament badge clipped to my collar.

I look like someone who belongs at nationals.

I just need to prove it.

The welcome ceremony is in the Grand Ballroom, even more overwhelming than the lobby. Six hundred students, plus coaches and officials, packed into a massive space with round tables.

Wellington claims a table near the middle. I scan the room automatically—Oakridge is three tables over.

David's sitting with his team, composed in his Oakridge blazer. As if sensing my gaze, he glances over. Our eyes meet.

He raises his eyebrows slightly. I nod. He nods back.

Then we both look away.

"You two are so weird," Riley mutters next to me.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just observing."

The ceremony begins with speeches from tournament officials, then judge introductions—former national champions and college debate coaches who look appropriately intimidating.

After the speeches, there's a reception with refreshments. The room dissolves into mingling—teams introducing themselves, sizing up competition.

I grab sparkling water and stand near the ballroom's edge, observing. This is my competition—six hundred students who want what I want.

"Overwhelming, right?"

I turn. David's standing a few feet away, also holding sparkling water, also watching the room.

"A little," I admit.

"Three hundred teams. Most of them won't make it past prelims."

"We will."

It's not a question or hope—it's certainty. David nods, matching my confidence with his own.

"Obviously."

We stand in oddly comfortable silence for a moment, both watching the organized chaos of the reception. It should be weird standing here with David Sterling, but after two days in a van, it's starting to feel almost normal.

"Different brackets," David says finally.

"I noticed."

"Won't face each other until semis at earliest."

"If we both make semis."

"When we both make semis," he corrects.

I glance at him. "Confident."

"Prepared," he says, echoing his earlier comment from registration. Then he adds, "Besides, it would be disappointing to make it to nationals and not face you in a round that matters."

The comment catches me off guard. "That's what you want? To debate me?"

"I want to win nationals," David clarifies. "But yes. If I'm going to win, I'd rather beat the best competition. That includes you."

It's possibly the closest thing to a compliment David Sterling has ever given me, and I'm not sure how to respond.

"Same," I finally say. "Beating you at nationals would be more satisfying than beating anyone else."

"Good. So we both advance through prelims and meet in finals."

"Deal."

We shake hands, formal and serious, like we're sealing a pact. His grip is firm and warm, and the moment feels significant in a way I can't fully articulate.

Then Marcus Webb appears, grabbing David's shoulder. "Sterling, Professor wants the team to review prelim assignments."

"Coming." David looks at me. "See you tomorrow."

"See you."

He walks away, and I'm left standing by the refreshment table, trying to process what just happened. Did David Sterling and I just agree to both advance to finals so we can face each other? Did we shake hands on it like some kind of sports movie scene?

Riley materializes at my side. "Please tell me you didn't just make some kind of rivals-to-romance pact with David Sterling."

"It wasn't—we were just—it's a competition agreement."

"Uh-huh. Jordan, you two shook hands like you were pledging eternal something."

"Eternal competition," I correct. "Which is different than—" I stop. Different than what? What was I about to say?

Riley's grin is insufferable. "This is fascinating. Please continue."

"I'm not continuing anything. We have preliminary rounds tomorrow. I need to focus."

"Right. Focus. On debate. Definitely not on David Sterling."

I walk away before Riley can say anything else that makes me question my life choices.

The reception ends at eight-thirty, and teams disperse. Back in room 1247, I lay out tomorrow's materials with methodical precision. Laptop charged. Debate case organized. Blazer ready. Alarm set for six AM.

Everything under control.

Riley and Amanda are in bed by nine-thirty, but I'm too wired to sleep. I review files until eleven, then lie in bed staring at the ceiling. Tomorrow, everything begins. Three preliminary rounds determining if I advance.

At eleven-thirty, I give up on sleep, grab the ice bucket, and head to the hallway.

The hotel is quiet at this hour—most debaters probably asleep or in rooms doing last-minute prep. The ice machine is down the hall near the elevators, tucked into a small alcove.

I'm filling my ice bucket when I hear footsteps.

David Sterling rounds the corner, also carrying an ice bucket, and stops when he sees me.

We both freeze, caught in the awkward reality of running into each other at the ice machine at eleven-thirty at night before nationals.

"Hayes," he says, because apparently we're still on last name basis.

"Sterling."

"Can't sleep?"

"Pre-tournament nerves."

"Same." He waits while I finish filling my bucket, then takes his turn at the machine. The ice clatters loudly in the quiet hallway.

"Big day tomorrow," I say, then immediately feel stupid for stating the obvious.

"First prelims," David agrees. "Sets the tone for the whole tournament."

"No pressure."

"Tons of pressure."

He finishes with the ice machine, and we both stand there awkwardly, ice buckets in hand, neither of us quite moving toward our respective rooms.

"Listen," David says finally. "About earlier. The handshake thing. I didn't mean to make it weird."

"It wasn't weird."

"Riley looked at us like we'd just signed a blood oath."

I almost smile. "Riley has theories."

"Marcus too. Apparently I'm 'too invested in the Hayes rivalry.'" He makes air quotes with one hand, still holding the ice bucket with the other.

"Are you? Invested?"

David considers the question seriously. "Yeah. I think I am. You're the best competition I've had in two years. Every round we've debated, you've pushed me to be better. So yes, I'm invested in finally getting a definitive answer about which of us is actually superior."

It's the most honest thing he's said to me, and it mirrors exactly how I feel about him.

"Same," I admit. "The rivalry with you has made me sharper than any other opponent."

"So tomorrow we both dominate prelims."

"Obviously."

"And then semis."

"Naturally."

"And then finals, where we finally settle this."

"Deal."

We're both smiling slightly now, and it's strange how this feels less like hostility and more like... partnership? Alliance? Mutual respect wrapped in competitive drive?

"I should get back," David says. "Try to sleep before rounds."

"Yeah. Me too."

But neither of us moves immediately.

"Good luck tomorrow," David says finally. "I mean—not too much luck. But enough that you make it to finals."

"You too. Don't lose to anyone before I get the chance to beat you."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

He heads back down the hallway toward his room. I wait until he disappears around the corner before returning to mine, ice bucket in hand, mind spinning.

Riley stirs when I slip back into bed. "Where'd you go?"

"Ice machine."

"Mm. Run into anyone?"

Of course she knows. Riley always knows.

"Go to sleep," I tell her.

"You should too. Big day tomorrow."

She's right. Tomorrow everything begins. The preliminary rounds that will determine if I advance. The first test of whether I'm actually good enough to compete at this level.

And somewhere in this hotel, in a room twelve floors up or down, David Sterling is lying awake thinking about the same thing.

Two years of rivalry brought us here.

Tomorrow we start proving who's actually the best.

I close my eyes and finally, finally drift off to sleep.
