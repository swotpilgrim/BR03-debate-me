# Chapter 28: The Final Morning

I wake up with sunlight streaming through the hotel window and a text message notification on my phone.

David: *Good morning. See you at breakfast?*

I'm smiling before I'm fully conscious.

Me: *Give me twenty minutes.*

Riley stirs in her bed. "Is that David?"

"Maybe."

"It's definitely David." She grins. "You had the dopiest smile when you looked at your phone."

"I do not have a dopey smile."

"You absolutely do. It's adorable." Riley sits up, stretching. "So. Last night. You came back glowing and said you kissed. I need more details."

"It was perfect."

"I already got that much. I want specifics. Was it sweet? Was it hot? Did he use tongue?"

"Riley!"

"What? I'm invested in this relationship."

Amanda groans from her bed. "Can you two gossip after I'm awake? It's too early for romance interrogation."

"It's eight-thirty," Riley says. "And this is the most interesting thing that's happened all trip. Jordan Hayes kissed David Sterling."

"Finally," Amanda mumbles into her pillow.

I get out of bed and start getting ready. Last day of the road trip. Final three hours in the van, then back to Wellington, then Oakridge drives away and nationals is officially over.

And David and I have to figure out what we are to each other when we're not sharing vans and hotel lobbies.

Riley corners me in the bathroom while I'm brushing my teeth.

"Okay. Amanda's in the shower. Give me the full story."

I rinse my mouth and meet her eyes in the mirror. "I went down to the lobby. He was there. We talked about what happens when we go back to Connecticut, about whether this is real. And then he asked if he could kiss me, and I said yes."

"And?"

"And it was perfect. Sweet and nervous and perfect."

Riley's smile is huge. "I'm so happy for you. You deserve someone who sees how amazing you are."

"What if it doesn't work? What if the distance is too hard or we can't make time or—"

"Jordan. Stop catastrophizing." Riley puts her hand on my shoulder. "You're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to try something even if you don't have guarantees. David Sterling is clearly crazy about you. That's a good starting point."

"I'm crazy about him too."

"I know. Everyone knows. You've been dancing around each other all week." She grins. "Now you get to actually be together instead of pretending you're just rivals."

I finish getting ready and we head down to the hotel breakfast area. Both teams are already there—Wellington at one long table, Oakridge at another nearby. David's sitting with Marcus and the sophomore debaters, but he looks up when I walk in.

Our eyes meet across the room, and he smiles.

I smile back, and Riley elbows me. "So obvious."

"Shut up."

"Never."

I get breakfast from the buffet—scrambled eggs, fruit, toast—and sit at the Wellington table. But I'm hyper-aware of David twenty feet away. The way he occasionally glances over. The way I keep wanting to look at him.

"You're not subtle," Amanda says quietly beside me.

"I'm being completely normal."

"You've looked at him approximately forty times in the last five minutes."

"Have not."

"Have too. It's fine. It's cute. We all ship it."

I focus on eating my breakfast, trying to actually be normal. But then David gets up to refill his orange juice, and as he passes our table, his hand briefly touches my shoulder—just a light touch, two seconds, gone before anyone who isn't paying attention would notice.

But I notice. And judging by Riley's knowing look, she notices too.

Coach Brennan stands up, getting everyone's attention. "All right, teams. We need to be on the road by nine-thirty. Make sure your rooms are checked out and luggage is in the van by nine-fifteen. Final leg home today."

There's a collective energy in the room—relief at finishing the trip mixed with sadness that it's ending. Both teams start gathering plates, heading back to rooms to collect belongings.

I'm walking toward the elevator when someone falls into step beside me.

"Morning," David says quietly.

"Morning."

"Did you sleep well?"

"Eventually. You?"

"Same." He glances at me, and there's something warm in his expression. "I kept thinking about last night."

"Me too."

The elevator arrives and we step inside. No one else joins us. For thirty seconds, we're alone in the small space.

"Jordan," David says, and his voice is low. "When we get back to Connecticut, I want—"

The elevator doors open on our floor. Riley and Amanda are waiting in the hallway.

"We'll talk more in the van?" I suggest.

"Yeah. Okay."

We all head to our rooms to pack up. Riley immediately starts pestering me for details about the elevator conversation, but there isn't much to tell. Just David looking at me like I'm something precious, and the weight of everything unsaid between us.

Twenty minutes later, everyone's checked out and loading the van for the final time. Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell are discussing the fastest route home. The younger debaters are trading social media handles and promising to stay in touch. Marcus is helping load debate cases into the back.

And David is standing by the van entrance, watching me approach.

"Back row?" he asks.

"Back row."

We climb in together, settling into the familiar spots. But this time when his knee brushes against mine, it feels intentional. When our shoulders touch, neither of us moves away.

The van pulls out of the hotel parking lot, heading north toward Connecticut. Final leg of the journey home.

"So," Marcus says from the row ahead of us, turning around with a massive grin. "You two seem cozy this morning."

"Marcus," David warns.

"What? I'm just observing that my best friend and his quote-unquote 'rival' are sitting awfully close together."

Riley joins in from her seat across the aisle. "I noticed that too. Very interesting development."

"You're all terrible," I say.

"We're supportive," Riley corrects. "There's a difference."

David's hand finds mine in the space between our seats. "They're not going to let this go."

"Nope," Marcus says cheerfully. "You finally stopped being emotionally constipated about your feelings for Jordan Hayes. We're going to celebrate this."

"I wasn't emotionally constipated."

"You absolutely were," I say. "We both were."

David laughs. "Fair enough."

The van settles into comfortable road trip mode for the last time. Younger debaters nap or listen to music. The coaches discuss next season. And in the back row, David and I sit close together, hands linked where most people can't see, both processing what comes next.

"What are you thinking?" David asks quietly.

"That I don't want this trip to end."

"Me neither. But it has to."

"I know." I lean my head against his shoulder, and he doesn't pull away. "David, when we get back to Wellington—"

"I want to keep seeing you," he says. "Not just at tournaments or debate events. Actually seeing you. Dating you."

My heart does something complicated in my chest. "Even though we're at different schools?"

"It's thirty minutes. We can figure it out."

"And after graduation? When we're at college?"

"Both in New England. Both in Boston, actually—you're going to BU, I'm at Harvard. That's closer than we are now."

I haven't let myself think that far ahead. But he's right—we'll both be in Boston starting in August. Different universities, but same city.

"So you want to try this," I say. "Actually try."

"I want to try this." He squeezes my hand. "Jordan, I spent two years competing against you and wishing I could get to know you outside debate. Now I finally can. I'm not going to waste that opportunity."

"What if we're terrible at dating? What if we're only good at being rivals?"

"Then we'll be terrible at dating together." He smiles. "But I don't think we will be. I think we're going to be excellent at it."

From the front of the van, Coach Brennan's voice carries back. "Professor Caldwell and I have been discussing something. It's come to our attention that our team captains seem to have become... friendlier over the course of this trip."

"Friendlier is one word for it," Professor Caldwell says, amusement clear in his voice.

Marcus cracks up. Riley grins. Several other team members turn to look at us.

David and I exchange glances.

"Is this a problem?" David asks.

"Not at all," Coach Brennan says. "We're just amused that it took sharing a van for six hundred miles for you two to figure out what everyone else already knew."

"Which is?" I ask.

"That you're perfect for each other," Riley supplies. "Honestly. We've been waiting for this since day one."

"Day one of the trip?" David says.

"Day one of your rivalry," Marcus corrects. "You've been obsessed with each other for two years. We all saw it."

I feel my face heat. "That's not—we were just competing—"

"You were absolutely obsessed with him," Riley says. "Every tournament, you'd track his results. Every round you won, you'd wonder if David won his too. Every awards ceremony, you'd look for him in the crowd."

"I did not."

"You absolutely did. I've been watching you for two years, Jordan. I know."

David is trying not to laugh. "Marcus says I did the same thing. Kept tabs on Jordan's rankings, asked about Wellington's results, made sure I knew where she was in the bracket at every tournament."

"Because you wanted to beat me."

"Because I wanted to see you. The beating you part was just the only way I could justify it."

The admission hangs in the air between us. Two years of rivalry that was always something more, and both of us too focused on competition to see it.

"Well," I say finally. "We're idiots."

"Complete idiots," David agrees.

"But you figured it out eventually," Riley says. "That's what matters."

The van crosses into Connecticut. Familiar landscape appears outside the windows—the highway we've driven countless times for tournaments, the exits we know by heart. We're almost home.

David's thumb traces circles on the back of my hand. "Next weekend. I'll drive to Wellington. We'll figure out what this looks like when we're not trapped in a van together."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Let's figure it out."

He smiles, and I smile back, and in the front of the van Coach Brennan tells Professor Caldwell that he's never seen two people more perfectly matched for both debate and disaster.

And sitting here in the back row with David's hand in mine and the final hour of the trip stretching ahead, I think Coach Brennan might be right.

We're perfectly matched. For debate, for challenge, for pushing each other to be better.

And maybe, just maybe, for partnership.
