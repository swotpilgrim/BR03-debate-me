# Chapter 13: Preliminary Rounds Begin

The alarm goes off at six AM, and I'm awake before the sound fully registers. My body knows what today is—preliminary rounds at nationals. The moment I've been preparing for all year.

Riley and Amanda stir in the other bed as I slip into the bathroom to shower and get ready. By six-thirty, we're all dressed in formal debate attire, running through final prep over terrible hotel coffee and granola bars from the vending machine.

"You've got this," Riley says, seeing my nervous energy. "Just do what you always do."

"What I always do at regionals," I correct. "This is nationals."

"Same debates, bigger stage. You're ready."

At seven-fifteen, we head downstairs to meet Coach and the team. The hotel is alive with debaters moving toward conference rooms and convention center tournament venues.

My first round is at eight-thirty in conference room 3B. I arrive at eight-fifteen to settle and review notes. The room is standard: judges' table at front, two podiums facing each other, chairs for observers.

My opponent arrives at eight-twenty—a girl from a California school wearing a blazer with an impressive array of tournament pins. She looks confident, experienced, probably competed at nationals before.

Good. I want strong competition.

The judges file in—three of them, all carrying scorecards and looking appropriately serious. One introduces herself as a former national champion from the early 2000s. The pressure ratchets up another notch.

The round begins.

And everything I've practiced, everything I've prepared, clicks into place.

My opening statement is strong—I hit every point I planned, my voice steady and confident. Cross-examination goes smoothly—I anticipate her arguments and have rebuttals ready. When she delivers her case, I take notes quickly, already formulating responses.

By the time we reach final rebuttals, I know I've won this round.

The judges deliberate for only five minutes before announcing: Wellington Hall.

"Strong performance," one judge says as I collect my materials. "Well-structured arguments, excellent anticipation of counterpoints. Keep it up."

I thank them and exit the room, adrenaline surging. One preliminary down. I won. Decisively.

In the hallway, Riley's waiting. "Well?"

"Won."

She whoops and hugs me. "Told you. Same as always, just bigger stage."

"Two more prelims today."

"You'll win those too."

Between rounds, the convention center is organized chaos. Students flowing between rooms, coaches giving feedback, teams huddling to review performance. I grab coffee from a cart near the main entrance and take a moment to breathe.

That's when I see him.

David's across the corridor, standing outside a conference room, talking with Marcus Webb. He's holding his debate case and looks focused, intense. Probably just finished a round or about to compete in one.

As I watch, Professor Caldwell approaches and says something. David nods, responds, gestures as he explains something—probably analyzing his performance. Even from this distance, I can see the precision in his movements, the way he communicates with his whole body when he's engaged in debate discussion.

I should look away. I need to focus on my own next round, not watch David Sterling between competitions.

But I keep watching anyway.

A few minutes later, David enters a conference room for what must be his next round. The door closes behind him, but there's a window—standard convention center glass that allows observation.

I tell myself I'm just curious about competition. That watching other debaters is strategic intelligence gathering. That it has nothing to do with David specifically.

I walk closer to the window and look in.

David's at the far podium, setting up his materials with that methodical precision I recognize. His opponent—someone from an East Coast school—takes the opposite podium. Judges settle at their table.

The round begins.

I should leave. I have my own second round in an hour and should be preparing.

Instead, I watch.

David's opening statement is technical and strategic, building his case with the kind of logical progression that's always made him formidable. But watching from outside the round, not as his opponent but as an observer, I notice something I've never quite seen before.

He's passionate.

Underneath the composed exterior and precise argumentation, there's real engagement. When he makes a point he particularly believes in, his voice changes slightly—not dramatic, but enough that you can hear he cares about what he's saying. When his opponent challenges him, he leans forward slightly, energized by the intellectual sparring.

This isn't just about winning for David Sterling. It's about the debate itself.

I've always known he was good. I've known he was strategic, well-prepared, technically excellent. But I never quite recognized that he loves this the way I do—not just the victory, but the actual process of argumentation and intellectual competition.

It's humanizing in a way I'm not entirely comfortable with.

The round continues. David's cross-examination is sharp but fair, his rebuttals precisely targeted. I can't hear everything through the glass, but I can read enough body language and see enough judge reactions to know he's winning.

"Jordan?"

I turn sharply. Amanda's standing behind me, looking curious.

"Your next round is in forty minutes," she says. "You okay?"

"Fine. Just observing competition."

Amanda glances through the window at David, then back at me with a knowing expression. "Right. Competition."

"Don't start."

"I'm not starting anything. Just noting that you're watching David Sterling debate instead of prepping for your own round."

She's not wrong, which is annoying.

"I'm done observing," I say, walking away from the window. "Let's go review my case one more time."

My second preliminary round at eleven is against a team from Illinois—strong, experienced, but I'm sharper today than I've ever been. I win by a comfortable margin.

Two down, one to go.

By noon, I'm starving and exhausted. The adrenaline from competing is draining, and I need food. The convention center has a food court area with various fast food options, and both Wellington and Oakridge teams converge there at the same time.

We end up pushing tables together because the food court is crowded and splitting up makes no sense. It's becoming routine now—Wellington and Oakridge mixing naturally, the artificial divide from the beginning of the trip completely dissolved.

I sit with Riley and Amanda, and Marcus Webb and Christopher Hayes end up at the same table. David takes a seat three chairs down, close enough for conversation but not directly next to me.

"How'd everyone's prelims go?" Marcus Chen asks.

"Two for two," Amanda says proudly. "Both wins."

"Same," Liam adds.

Around the table, everyone reports similar success. Wellington and Oakridge are both performing well—no one's been eliminated yet, everyone's advancing to afternoon rounds.

"Sterling's been destroying his bracket," Marcus Webb says, nudging David. "Both wins by huge margins."

"Hayes has been doing the same," Riley counters, grinning at me. "The judges in her second round looked genuinely impressed."

This is weird—our teams bragging about us to each other. Like we're allies instead of rivals.

"What strategy are you using for the education policy topic?" Riley asks David suddenly. "Jordan mentioned you frame it with ethical foundations first, then empirics?"

David looks surprised to be asked directly. "Yeah. Establish moral framework, then reinforce with data. Judges respond better to comprehensive arguments."

"That's smart," Riley says. "Different from how we typically structure it. Jordan, you do moral and economic together, right?"

And suddenly we're in a full team discussion about debate strategy, with both Wellington and Oakridge contributing techniques and approaches. It's collaborative in a way I never expected—competitors sharing intelligence because we all respect the craft.

"The problem with pure empirical approaches," I find myself saying, "is you lose judges who value ethical reasoning. You need both."

"Agreed," David says, looking at me directly. "Balance is key. Too much pathos and you seem manipulative. Too much data and you seem cold."

"Exactly."

We're nodding at each other across the table, united in debate philosophy, and I'm aware that Riley is watching this interaction with barely concealed amusement.

"You two should co-write a debate theory textbook," Marcus Webb jokes. "Sterling and Hayes on Argumentation Strategy."

"That would require us agreeing on things," David says dryly.

"You're literally agreeing right now," Marcus points out.

"On debate theory. Not on who's actually better at implementing it."

"Obviously I'm better at implementation," I say.

"Your record suggests otherwise," David counters.

"My record is eighty-three percent wins. Your record is eighty-seven. Four percentage points isn't exactly dominant."

"Four points over two years is statistically significant."

"Four points over two years could be luck."

We're debating our debate records, and everyone else at the table is watching like it's entertainment.

"You two are exhausting," Riley finally says. "Can't you just admit you're both good and move on?"

David and I look at each other.

"We're both good," I concede.

"But I'm better," David adds.

"You wish."

"I have the data."

"Data isn't everything."

"It's most things."

Riley throws a napkin at both of us. "Stop. Eat your lunch. You've got third prelims this afternoon."

The conversation shifts to other topics—discussion about judges, tough rounds, the hotel's terrible breakfast. The table becomes just a group of debaters sharing a meal, the school divisions meaningless.

But I'm hyperaware of David three chairs down, occasionally catching his eye when someone makes a joke or when we both react to the same comment. Each time, there's a flicker of connection—shared understanding, maybe, or mutual respect wrapped in competitive drive.

After lunch, we all disperse for afternoon rounds. I have ninety minutes until my third prelim, so I find a quiet corner in the convention center and review notes.

When I glance up, I can see David in another corner doing the same thing. He's focused on his laptop, occasionally making notes, completely absorbed in preparation.

Two years ago, watching David Sterling prepare would have felt like intelligence gathering on an enemy.

Now it just feels like watching someone who understands exactly what this competition means. Someone who's just as driven, just as passionate, just as determined as I am.

My phone buzzes with a text from Riley: *Third round soon. You've got this. Also, stop making eyes at Sterling across the convention center*

I text back: *Not making eyes. Focusing on debate*

Riley: *Sure you are*

I turn off my phone and return to prep.

One more preliminary round today. Then two tomorrow. Then semifinals, if I advance.

And somewhere in this tournament, on the same path toward finals, David Sterling is preparing just as hard as I am.

This is what I came for—the competition, the challenge, the chance to prove I'm the best.

But it's getting harder to ignore that the person pushing me to be my best is the same person I've spent two years trying to beat.
