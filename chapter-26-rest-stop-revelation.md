# Chapter 26: Rest Stop Revelation

The van stops at a rest area in Delaware for dinner and gas as the sun descends toward the horizon. Teams scatter—younger debaters to bathrooms, coaches toward coffee, everyone grateful to stretch after hours sitting.

I grab my jacket even though the evening is warm, needing fresh air more than warmth. Instead of following everyone inside, I walk to the edge of the parking lot where there's a grassy area with picnic tables.

The spring evening is perfect—warm but not hot, light breeze carrying the smell of new growth. Beyond the parking lot, trees are leafing out, and sunset starts to color the western sky orange and pink.

I lean against a picnic table, watching the sky change, trying to process the last few hours. The conversation with David. The admissions of feelings. The decision to try this despite complications.

It should feel overwhelming. Instead, it feels right.

"Thought you might be out here."

I turn to find David walking toward me across the grass, hands in his pockets, that slight smile on his face that I've come to recognize as genuine rather than performed.

"How did you know?"

"You got that look in the van. The one that means you're processing something too big for a crowded space." He stops beside me, close but not touching. "Also, Riley said you headed outside instead of toward food."

"Riley needs to mind her business."

"Riley cares about you."

"I know." I turn back to the sunset. "I just needed a minute to think."

David leans against the table beside me. "About?"

"About tomorrow. When we go back to separate schools." I glance at him. "About whether this can survive reality."

"Are you having doubts?"

"Not doubts. Just awareness of how complicated this will be."

He's quiet, then speaks carefully. "Can I tell you something I've been thinking about?"

"Always."

"You said earlier that debating me made you feel respected as an equal."

"You never treated me like a scholarship student who got lucky."

"That's because from our first tournament sophomore year, you made it impossible to dismiss you." He turns to face me. "You were fierce and brilliant and relentless. You didn't care about my family name or Oakridge's reputation. You just cared about winning on merit."

"That's how it should be."

"But it's not always how it is. Most opponents facing a Sterling are either intimidated or trying to prove something. Either way, it's about my name rather than the debate. But you? You looked at me across that first podium and didn't care who my family was. You only cared whether my arguments were good enough."

I remember that first debate. Regional semifinals, two years ago. I was nervous and determined. David was developing his Sterling champion reputation. When we faced each other, I was too focused on winning to be intimidated.

"You won that round," I say.

"By two points. Closest debate I'd had all season." He smiles slightly. "Afterward, I thought that if Jordan Hayes kept competing like that, she'd be dangerous."

"You were thinking about me after that round?"

"I was thinking about you after every round. At first because you were the toughest competition. But somewhere along the way, the obsession with beating you became an obsession with you. How you think, how you argue, how you never give up. How your eyes light up when you land a good rebuttal, or how you bite your lip thinking through counterarguments."

My breath catches. "You noticed those things?"

"I noticed everything. Told myself it was strategic analysis, studying my opponent. But it was more." He steps closer. "Jordan, I've been falling for you longer than I realized. The road trip just made it impossible to ignore."

The honesty in his voice catches me off guard. David Sterling, who spends so much energy maintaining composure and meeting expectations, is standing in a rest area parking lot at sunset telling me he's been falling for me for who knows how long.

"I noticed things about you too," I admit. "The way you adjust your tie when you're nervous before a round. How you always review your notes in the same order—framework first, then evidence, then rebuttals. The way you genuinely listen when your opponent makes a good point, even mid-debate."

"That's strategic analysis."

"Maybe. But I also noticed how you are with your teammates. Patient with the sophomores when they're learning, encouraging when someone's having a rough tournament. How you thank the judges after every round, even when you lose. How you're actually kind underneath all that prep school polish."

David is close enough now that I can see the different colors in his eyes—brown with flecks of gold, made brighter by the setting sun. Close enough that if I reached out, I could touch him.

"So we've both been noticing each other," he says quietly. "For two years, while we were supposed to just be rivals."

"Apparently."

"And now what? Now that we've admitted it?"

I think about the question. Tomorrow we go back to Connecticut. Nationals will be over. The forced proximity of the road trip will end. We'll be at separate schools with finals and graduation approaching and college looming in the fall.

"Now we decide whether to explore this or let it go."

"Do you want to let it go?" David's voice is careful, like he's trying not to influence my answer.

"No. Do you?"

"Absolutely not." The answer comes immediate and certain. "Jordan, I don't have all the logistics figured out. I don't know exactly how we make this work with different schools and busy schedules and everything that's coming. But I know I don't want the road trip to be the end of whatever this is between us."

"Neither do I." The admission feels huge. "David, I spent two years thinking you were just my rival. Just the opponent I needed to beat to prove myself. But you're not just anything. You're—"

"What?"

"You're the person who sees me completely. Who respects my capabilities without being threatened by them. Who challenges me intellectually while making me feel like who I am is already enough." I meet his eyes. "You're the person I want to keep knowing, keep talking to, keep arguing with about everything from debate topics to movies to which coffee shop has the best lattes."

David's smile is beautiful and unguarded. "You're the person who makes me want to be genuine instead of performing. Who makes me question family expectations because what you think of me matters more than maintaining a legacy. Who makes me believe that who I actually am might be enough, even without the championships and the tradition."

We're standing very close now, sunset painting everything gold and orange. Around us, the rest stop continues—travelers coming and going, our teams inside getting food, the world moving forward. But in this moment, it feels like just David and me, finally acknowledging what's been building since that first debate.

"Can I ask you something?" David says.

"Anything."

"If I wanted to drive to Wellington next weekend and take you to dinner—not debate-related, not a team event, just you and me getting to know each other as people—would you say yes?"

My heart races. "Are you asking me on a date, David Sterling?"

"I'm absolutely asking you on a date. A real, official, this-is-romantic date."

"Then yes. I would absolutely say yes."

His smile transforms his whole face, making him look younger, less burdened. "Good. Great. I'll text you and we'll figure out logistics—"

"David."

"Yeah?"

"Stop planning. Just be here with me right now."

He laughs, genuine and warm. "You're right. Sorry. Debate brain doesn't shut off easily."

"I know the feeling."

We stand there a moment longer, both smiling, both aware we've crossed a threshold. Tomorrow we return to Connecticut and reality. But right now, we have this—acknowledgment, understanding, the beginning of something neither of us fully understands yet but both want to explore.

"We should probably head back inside," David says eventually. "Our teams are going to wonder where we are."

"Let them wonder a little longer."

But we start walking toward the rest stop entrance anyway, and this time when David reaches for my hand, I take it without hesitation. Let people see. Let the teams gossip. This is real, and I'm tired of hiding it.

At the entrance, we pause. Through the glass doors, I can see both teams scattered throughout the food court—Wellington at one cluster of tables, Oakridge at another, Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell getting coffee together.

"Ready to face the inevitable teasing?" David asks.

"With you? Yeah. I think I am."

We push through the doors together, hands still linked, and walk toward our teams. Riley sees us first, and her eyes go wide before a huge grin spreads across her face. Marcus notices a second later and immediately elbows one of the other Oakridge students.

By the time we reach the tables, both teams are watching us with various levels of amusement and knowing smiles.

"So," Riley says as we approach. "You two were outside for a while."

"We were talking," I say.

"Uh huh. Talking." Marcus grins. "Is that what we're calling it now?"

David doesn't let go of my hand. "We were having a conversation about post-nationals plans."

"Right. Post-nationals plans." Riley exchanges a look with Marcus. "And those plans include...?"

I look at David, and he looks at me, and we both smile. Whatever happens next, whatever complications come, we're facing them together.

"Those plans include figuring out how to make this work," I say, gesturing between David and me. "Whatever this is."

"Finally!" Amanda's voice carries from down the table. "We've been waiting for you two to figure it out for days!"

The teasing continues as we get food and rejoin our teams, but it's good-natured and warm. Both Wellington and Oakridge seem genuinely happy that their captains found something beyond rivalry.

As we eat dinner together—really together, not separated by team boundaries or competition tension—I catch David's eye across the table. He smiles, and I smile back, and it hits me that this is real. We're really doing this.

And sitting here surrounded by friends, with sunset fading outside and the road trip almost over, I feel ready. Ready for the challenge of long-distance dating. Ready for the complications of separate schools. Ready to explore what David and I could be together when we're not opponents.

After all, we're both used to difficult challenges. This is just a different kind of competition—one where we're on the same team instead of opposite sides.

And I think we might be even better at partnership than we were at rivalry.
