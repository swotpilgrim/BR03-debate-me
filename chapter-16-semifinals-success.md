# Chapter 16: Semifinals Success

The conference room is packed with observers for semifinals. I stand at my podium, debate case open, feeling the weight of every eye in the room. Win this round, and I'm in finals. Lose, and nationals is over.

When my turn comes for the opening statement, I launch into my case with everything I have. The arguments flow with practiced precision, but there's something else underneath—a passion that makes my voice ring clear and forceful. I'm fighting for every point, building my case with surgical precision while letting my conviction show through.

My opponent—a senior from San Diego with an impressive record—is strong. During cross-examination, she asks sharp questions designed to expose weaknesses, and I have to think fast. But I've prepared for this. When I deliver my rebuttal, I can see the judges leaning forward, pens moving rapidly.

The round ends with both of us exhausted. Riley catches my eye from the observer section and gives me a subtle thumbs up.

After what feels like an eternity but is probably only fifteen minutes, the judges announce their decision. "We award this round to Jordan Hayes of Wellington Hall."

The words wash over me like a wave. I'm through. I'm in finals.

Riley meets me outside with Amanda and our team. "You were incredible!" Amanda says. "That rebuttal was devastating!"

Coach Brennan approaches with measured approval. "Well done, Jordan. That's exactly the performance we needed."

"Thanks, Coach." I should feel pure exhilaration. I made it to nationals finals—the goal I've been working toward all year. And I do feel excited, but there's something else underneath. A strange nervous flutter.

"Oakridge's semifinal is starting in twenty minutes," Riley says, watching my face carefully. "David Sterling versus Chicago."

My stomach flips. "Right."

"You want to get lunch? Review your round?"

"Yeah, sounds good." But even as I say it, I'm calculating timing. David's round will be over in what, an hour and a half?

We grab sandwiches and spread out in the lobby. I should be reviewing my performance, but I keep checking the time.

"You know," Riley says after I've glanced at my phone for the third time, "if you want to go see if he won, you could just go."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Uh huh." She takes a bite of her sandwich. "You're not at all wondering if David Sterling made it to finals."

I am wondering. I've been wondering since the moment I won my round. Because if David wins his semifinal, we'll face each other tomorrow. For the national championship. On the biggest stage in high school debate.

The thought makes my heart race in a way that feels different than normal pre-competition nerves.

"He'll probably win," I say, trying to sound casual. "He's too good not to."

Riley gives me a look but doesn't push it. We spend thirty minutes discussing strategies for finals, but I can't concentrate. Part of my brain is calculating when David's round will end.

Finally, I can't take it anymore. "I'm going to walk around, clear my head."

"Sure you are," Riley says with a knowing smile.

I head back toward the conference room area. David's round should be wrapping up soon. I tell myself it's strategy—I need to know who I might be facing tomorrow. That's a total lie and I know it.

I find a spot in the hallway with a view of the conference room door where David's competing. There are other people waiting too—teammates, observers, other debaters interested in seeing who advances. I'm just one person in a crowd. It's not weird that I'm here.

The door opens and people start filtering out. I recognize David's team members from Oakridge, then Professor Caldwell with his distinguished gray hair and impeccable suit. And then David himself, debate case in hand, and even from across the hallway I can see the tension in his shoulders start to release.

He won. I can tell from his posture, from the way Marcus claps him on the back, from the tight smile of satisfaction on Professor Caldwell's face.

David Sterling is going to finals.

Which means tomorrow, I'll face him for the national championship.

Our eyes meet across the crowded hallway, and everything else fades into background noise. We both made it. We're both exactly where we expected to be. This has been inevitable since we loaded into that van in Connecticut.

Neither of us looks away. There's something in this moment that feels too big for casual gestures. Tomorrow we'll debate each other for everything we've been working toward. Tomorrow one of us wins nationals, and one of us loses.

Tomorrow I have to stand across from David Sterling and pretend the road trip didn't change anything, that the conversations didn't make him into an actual person rather than just my rival.

Someone bumps into me, breaking the spell. David's team pulls him away. I turn and walk quickly in the opposite direction, my heart pounding harder than it should.

Riley is waiting exactly where I left her, and one look at my face tells her everything she needs to know. "He won."

"Yeah."

"So tomorrow—"

"Tomorrow I face David Sterling in the finals." I sink into the chair beside her. "This is what I wanted. This is exactly what I've been planning for."

"But?"

"But nothing. It's fine. It's good, actually. I get to beat him on the biggest stage possible." The words come out with less conviction than I'd like.

Riley studies me for a long moment. "You know, a week ago you would have said that with a lot more homicidal enthusiasm."

She's right, and that's what scares me. A week ago, the thought of facing David Sterling in finals would have filled me with pure competitive fire. I would have been planning his rhetorical destruction, visualizing his defeat, feeding off the rivalry that's defined our relationship for two years.

Now I'm remembering the way he looked at me across that hallway, and I don't know what I'm feeling.

"I need to focus," I say firmly. "Finals are tomorrow. Everything else can wait."

That evening, the tournament holds a celebratory dinner for finalists in the hotel ballroom. I change into the simple black dress I brought for the awards ceremony. When I arrive with the Wellington team, the room is already filling with debaters from across the country, everyone dressed up and buzzing with energy.

Round tables with white tablecloths fill the space. I find myself seated with finalists from Texas, Oregon, and Massachusetts. David is several tables away, but I'm hyperaware of his presence.

I make polite conversation about tournaments and schools. A girl from Portland asks about Wellington's program, and I discuss strategy and preparation methods. But every few minutes, my gaze drifts across the ballroom.

David is in a suit and tie, looking every inch the prep school golden boy. He's talking with composed confidence that used to infuriate me. Now I notice other things—the way he listens intently when someone else speaks, the slight smile when someone makes a good point.

Our eyes meet across the room more than once. Each time, there's a jolt of awareness that makes it hard to focus on whoever's talking to me.

After dinner, the tournament director takes the stage with a microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we'll witness the culmination of an extraordinary season of debate. Tonight, I want to recognize our finalists who have earned their place in tomorrow's championship rounds."

When my name is called, I stand and accept the recognition with gracious composure, very aware that David is watching from across the room.

Then the director says, "David Sterling, Oakridge Preparatory Academy." David stands to substantial applause. The director continues, "I should note that tomorrow's final round features a matchup many of you have been anticipating—Jordan Hayes and David Sterling have one of the most storied rivalries on the New England circuit. Their finals round promises to be exceptional."

Great. Now everyone is watching us, noting the rivalry, expecting fireworks. David meets my eyes again, and I can't read his expression.

The director concludes with wishes for fair competition, and the formal portion ends. People start mingling, and I find myself at the refreshments table next to David Sterling.

"Congratulations on making finals," he says quietly.

"You too." I pour myself water from a pitcher, grateful to have something to do with my hands. "That Chicago team was strong."

"So was San Diego. I watched part of your round." He's standing close enough that I can smell his cologne, something subtle and expensive that probably costs more than my entire formal outfit. "Your rebuttal was... formidable."

"Thanks." I should walk away. I should be focused on finals preparation, not standing here making small talk with my opponent. But I don't move. "Good luck tomorrow."

The words slip out before I can stop them, and I immediately regret them. You don't wish your opponent luck. You don't acknowledge their humanity the night before you face them in the most important debate of your life.

David looks surprised, then something softer crosses his face. "Good luck to you too."

We stand there for another moment, the weight of tomorrow hanging between us, before Marcus appears and pulls David away to talk to Professor Caldwell. Riley materializes at my side immediately.

"That looked intense."

"It was nothing. Just being professional."

"Jordan." Riley turns me to face her. "What's going on with you two?"

"Nothing. I don't know." I press my fingers to my temples. "Can we please not talk about this right now? I need to sleep. Finals are tomorrow."

But as I lie in bed hours later, sleep is impossible. Tomorrow I face David Sterling for the national championship. Tomorrow I have to stand across from him and compete with everything I have, treating him like the opponent he's supposed to be.

Tomorrow I have to pretend that the boy who shared his fears about family expectations, who made me laugh at rest stops, who looks at me like he actually sees me—doesn't exist.

Tomorrow I have to beat David Sterling. And for the first time in two years, I'm not sure I want to.
