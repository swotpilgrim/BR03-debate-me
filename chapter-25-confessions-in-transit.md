# Chapter 25: Confessions in Transit

The afternoon drive stretches long through Pennsylvania, and gradually the van falls quiet. Younger debaters nod off in middle rows, exhausted from nationals. Coaches doze in front seats. Even Riley and Marcus have gone silent, both plugged into headphones.

In the back row, David and I are the only ones still fully awake, watching landscape pass outside our windows.

The unexpected privacy feels like a gift. We can talk without the whole van listening, without performing for our teams.

"What are you thinking about?" David asks quietly.

I turn to look at him. "Everything. Senior year ending. Graduation in three weeks. College in the fall. How fast everything's changing."

"Scary?"

"A little. Maybe a lot." I shift to face him better. "Debate has been my whole identity for four years. Without tournaments and competition structure, I don't know who I am."

David nods. "I've been thinking the same thing. The Sterling legacy, family expectations, Professor Caldwell's constant reminders—it's all been tied to high school debate. Once that's over, what defines me? Who am I without the plaque?"

"Maybe that's a good thing," I say. "Maybe we both need to figure out who we are when we're not performing for other people's expectations."

"You think we've been performing?"

"Haven't we? Me trying to prove I deserve Wellington, you living up to the Sterling name. Both using debate victories as validation." I pause. "That's exhausting. And it doesn't actually work."

"No, it doesn't." He looks out the window, then back. "Can I tell you something?"

"Always."

"Losing to you in finals wouldn't have been the disaster I thought." His voice is careful. "Actually, part of me almost wishes you'd won."

"Why? You worked four years for that championship."

"Because then the hollow feeling would make sense—just disappointment from losing." He runs his hand through his hair. "But winning and still feeling empty told me something I couldn't ignore. The trophy doesn't fix anything. The validation I was chasing doesn't exist in metal and certificates."

"So where does it exist?"

David is quiet, staring at his hands. When he speaks, his voice is softer. "In being truly seen by someone who understands you. Not someone impressed by achievements or intimidated by your name. Just someone who sees you—all of you—and respects what they see."

My heart does something complicated. "David..."

"Debating you this weekend was the best part of nationals. Not because I won—that feels almost incidental now. But because you pushed me to be genuinely excellent. You saw every strategy and met me at every turn. You never let me coast. You made me earn every single point."

"That's just good competition."

"No, it's respect. Real respect for capabilities, not politeness or sportsmanship." He shifts to face me more directly. "You're the first opponent who made me feel challenged rather than just tested. You saw my abilities and refused to be intimidated. That mattered more than any trophy."

I don't know what to say. I've spent two years thinking of David as my rival, my obstacle, the person I needed to overcome. But hearing him articulate what our competition meant to him—it reframes everything.

"I feel the same way," I admit. "Losing to you didn't devastate me the way I expected because the debate itself was everything I love about competition. Being challenged intellectually, being pushed to my limits, being respected enough that my opponent brought their absolute best." I meet his eyes. "You gave me that. You never treated me like a scholarship student who got lucky or an overachiever who didn't quite measure up. You debated me like I was your equal."

"Because you are my equal." He reaches across, and his hand finds mine. "In capability, strategic thinking, passion for ideas. That's rare. Someone who matches you completely."

"I'm starting to understand."

We're holding hands in the back of the van. I should worry about someone waking up and seeing. But I'm not worried. What we have is rare.

"So what do we do with that?" I ask quietly. "With this understanding?"

"We explore it. See where it goes beyond debate."

"Even though it's complicated? Different schools, graduation coming, college starting?"

"Especially because it's complicated." David's thumb traces circles on my hand. "Simple would be going back to being rivals. Simple would be saying nationals was fun but now it's over. But simple isn't what we are."

"No. We're definitely not simple."

He smiles slightly. "We're two debate nerds who studied each other as opponents and accidentally discovered we like what we found."

"More than like," I say, and the admission feels huge. "David, I spent two years obsessed with beating you. But sometime during this road trip, the obsession changed. It became... something else."

"What?"

I gather courage. "Interest in you as a person. Attraction to who you are underneath the polish. Genuine affection for the David Sterling who admits vulnerability and cares about more than winning and sees me as a whole person."

David's hand tightens on mine. "Jordan, I need you to know something."

"What?"

"That somewhere between loading into this van and now, you stopped being Jordan Hayes, my rival, and became Jordan Hayes, the person I can't stop thinking about."

Oh.

"The person," he continues, voice low, "who I wanted to talk to at 2 AM before finals. The person whose opinion matters more than judges' scores or my family's approval. The person I chose to stand with in that hallway instead of celebrating with my team."

"David—"

"I'm not done." He shifts closer, and we're sitting sideways, facing each other while the van sleeps. "You're the person who makes me want to be better not from external pressure but because you deserve someone at their absolute best. You saw through every facade and still wanted to know what was underneath. You're the person I'm falling for, and I needed you to know before this trip ends."

My brain is trying to process his words, but my heart is moving faster. "You're falling for me?"

"I'm absolutely falling for you. Have been since you refused to back down about van snack payment." He manages a small smile. "Is that terrifying? Yes. Is the timing terrible? Absolutely. But is it true? Completely."

I should be careful. I should think about logistics and complications and how this could go wrong in a dozen different ways. But I'm tired of being careful. I'm tired of protecting myself from possibilities.

"I'm falling for you too," I say. "And it terrifies me because I don't know how to be vulnerable with someone who's seen me at my most intensely competitive. But I want to try. I want to see what we could be when we're not opponents."

David's smile is beautiful, unguarded in a way I've rarely seen. "So we're doing this? Actually trying to be together?"

"I think we are."

"Even though we don't have all the answers about how it works?"

"Especially because we don't have all the answers. We'll figure it out as we go."

The van rolls on through afternoon sunlight. Outside, landscape passes—Pennsylvania hills giving way to flatter terrain, highway signs counting down miles to Connecticut. Inside, the sleeping team breathes steadily, unaware of our conversation.

But David and I are hyperaware—of each other, of what we're creating, of the transformation from rivalry to something more complex and real.

"What happens when we get back?" I ask. "When we're at separate schools again?"

"We make time. We text and call about things beyond debate. We drive the thirty minutes on weekends. We figure out how to be Jordan and David, not just debate opponents with feelings."

"You make it sound manageable."

"It is. If we both want it enough."

"I want it," I say quietly. "I want to know who you are when you're not performing the Sterling heir role. I want to argue about movies instead of sanctions policy. I want to see who we are when there's no tournament bracket determining winner and loser."

"I want all of that too." David glances toward the front to make sure the coaches are still dozing, then leans closer. "Jordan, I know everything's uncertain. I know college is coming and we can't predict what happens. But right now, I want to be with you. And I want to try to make that work."

"Then let's try."

We sit like that for a while, hands linked, both processing what we're committing to. The rivalry that defined us for two years is transforming into something neither of us fully understands yet but both want to explore.

The van crosses into New York, then Connecticut. Familiar landscape replaces Pennsylvania hills. We're getting close now—another hour until Wellington, maybe ninety minutes at most.

"I'm going to miss this," David says.

"The van?"

"The proximity. Having you right here where I can talk to you without planning or scheduling or driving thirty minutes just to have a conversation."

"We'll make it work. We're strategic thinkers. We're good at solving complicated problems."

He laughs quietly. "Only we would approach a relationship like a debate problem to be solved."

"It's who we are."

"Yeah. It is." He looks at me with such fondness that my chest tightens. "And I wouldn't want to be figuring this out with anyone else."

In the middle rows, Riley starts to stir, stretching and yawning. Marcus pulls out his headphones. The coaches shift in front seats, becoming more alert as we approach home territory. The quiet privacy of the back row is ending.

David and I let go of each other's hands as the van becomes active again, but the connection remains. We're both smiling slightly, both aware something fundamental shifted during this drive, both ready to face whatever complications come next.

Because we're not just rivals anymore. We're not even just friends who used to compete.

We're something new. Something undefined. Something that started with intellectual combat and became mutual understanding and is growing into genuine affection.

And we're both willing to see where it goes.

The van exits the highway toward Wellington. Ten more minutes until campus. Until the road trip officially ends. Until nationals becomes just memory and we have to figure out how to make this work in real life.

But looking at David beside me, I feel ready. Ready for the challenge. Ready for the complication. Ready to explore what we could be together.

After all, we're both used to difficult opponents and complex strategies.

We'll figure this out too.
