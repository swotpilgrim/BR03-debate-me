# Chapter 23: Awards Ceremony

The hotel ballroom looks different in the evening. The tournament equipment has been cleared away, replaced by a stage with a podium and microphone. Round tables fill the space, decorated with simple centerpieces—this is a formal event, but still a high school tournament, not a black-tie affair. Teams sit together in their formal debate attire, the energy a mix of celebration and exhaustion.

I sit with the Wellington team at our assigned table, wearing the simple black dress I brought for this occasion. Riley is beside me in a navy dress, Amanda on my other side practically bouncing with excitement despite our second-place finish. Coach Brennan sits at the head of our table, looking proud even though we didn't bring home the championship.

Across the ballroom, I can see the Oakridge table. David sits with his team, wearing a dark suit that makes him look older, more polished. The championship trophy sits on their table, gleaming under the ballroom lights. Marcus is animated, talking with his hands, probably recounting the finals round. Professor Caldwell listens with dignified approval.

David catches my eye from across the room. He smiles slightly, and I feel my stomach flip in a way that has nothing to do with nerves and everything to do with our conversation in the hallway a few hours ago.

"You keep looking at him," Riley says quietly beside me.

"I'm not—"

"Jordan. You've glanced at the Oakridge table like six times in the last five minutes."

I turn to face my best friend. "Okay. Yes. I keep looking at him."

"Because?"

"Because..." I lower my voice. "Because we talked after the finals. Really talked. About the debate, and validation, and what's been happening between us."

Riley's eyes widen. "And?"

"And he said he has feelings for me."

Riley's hand grips my arm. "He said that? Actually said it out loud?"

"He said somewhere between the van ride and nationals, I stopped being his rival and became the person he can't stop thinking about."

"Oh my god." Riley is trying to keep her voice down but failing. "Jordan Hayes, what did you say back?"

"That I have feelings for him too. That I don't want to go back to just being opponents." Saying it out loud makes it more real, more terrifying. "Riley, I think I'm falling for David Sterling."

"You think? Jordan, you've been falling for him since that first rest stop argument about van snacks. I've been watching this happen in real time."

"Was I that obvious?"

"To me? Yes. To yourself? Apparently not." She squeezes my arm. "I'm happy for you. Even if the timing is completely insane."

The tournament director steps up to the podium, and the ballroom quiets. "Good evening, everyone. Thank you all for attending this year's National High School Debate Championship awards ceremony. We've witnessed exceptional competition this weekend, and tonight we celebrate all our finalists and champions."

The ceremony begins with recognition of various categories—top preliminary rounds, best individual speaker awards, team achievements. Each time a name is called, the recipient stands to applause and walks to the stage to receive their certificate or medal. The atmosphere is celebratory but formal, everyone on their best behavior.

When they reach the finals recognition, the tournament director says, "This year's championship final was one of the closest in tournament history. Both debaters demonstrated the highest level of skill and strategic thinking. Please join me in recognizing our finalists."

"Jordan Hayes, Wellington Hall Preparatory Academy."

I stand, my heart hammering, and walk toward the stage. The applause is warm and genuine. I climb the steps to the stage, and the tournament director hands me a silver finalist medal and a certificate.

"Exceptional debate, Ms. Hayes," he says quietly. "You should be very proud."

"Thank you."

I turn to face the audience for photos, and the cameras flash. From the stage, I can see the entire ballroom—Wellington's table with Riley beaming and Coach Brennan clapping, other teams I competed against throughout the weekend, and the Oakridge table where David is standing and applauding.

Our eyes meet across the room, and there's something different in how we're looking at each other now. Not rivals sizing each other up. Not even opponents respecting each other's skills. Something softer, something that makes my chest tighten.

I return to my seat, and the tournament director continues. "And our national champion, representing Oakridge Preparatory Academy—David Sterling."

The applause is thunderous. David stands and walks to the stage with that composed confidence, but I can see the slight tension in his shoulders. This is what he's been working toward his entire debate career—the moment that's supposed to validate everything, prove he's worthy of the Sterling name.

He accepts the championship trophy, larger and more ornate than my finalist medal. The tournament director shakes his hand, and they pose for official photos. David holds the trophy, looking every inch the prep school champion, and I wonder if he's still feeling that hollow emptiness he described earlier.

When he speaks briefly to thank the tournament organizers and his team, his voice is measured and professional. "This has been an honor. The competition was exceptional, and I'm grateful to everyone who made this tournament possible."

It's a perfect acceptance speech—gracious, humble, appropriate. But I can hear the careful control in his voice, the same tone he uses when he's managing expectations rather than expressing genuine emotion.

He returns to his table to more applause, and the ceremony continues with additional recognitions and closing remarks from the tournament director. Throughout it all, I'm hyperaware of David across the room, of the strange new reality that we're something more than rivals now.

After the formal program concludes, the reception begins. Tables of refreshments are set up along one wall, and teams start mingling, congratulating each other, taking photos. It's the social conclusion to nationals—a chance to celebrate before everyone disperses tomorrow.

Wellington gathers for a team photo with our various awards and medals. Coach Brennan gets us organized, making sure everyone's visible, and we smile for the camera. Second place at nationals is still an achievement worth celebrating.

"Speech!" Amanda demands when the photo is done. "Captain's speech!"

I laugh. "What am I supposed to say?"

"Tell us how you feel about the weekend," Riley suggests. "About making it to finals."

I look at my team—these people who've practiced with me all year, who supported me through the pressure of being captain, who celebrated every win and weathered every loss. "I'm proud of us," I say simply. "We worked hard, we competed at the highest level, and we represented Wellington exactly the way we should. Second place at nationals isn't disappointing—it's proof that we belong here."

"Hear, hear!" Riley raises her water glass, and everyone follows suit in a mock toast.

Across the room, I see David surrounded by the Oakridge team, also taking photos with the championship trophy. Marcus has him in another celebratory headlock. Professor Caldwell stands slightly apart, watching with satisfaction.

"You should go talk to him," Riley says, following my gaze.

"Now? In the middle of the reception?"

"When else? Tomorrow we're all heading home. Tonight's your chance."

She's right. Tomorrow both teams will pack up, check out, and travel back to Connecticut. Nationals will be over. Whatever David and I are becoming needs to start now, or it might not start at all.

"Okay. I'm going to—" I gesture vaguely toward the Oakridge table.

"Go get him, tiger." Riley grins. "And Jordan? Be happy. You deserve this."

I make my way through the crowd, navigating around other teams and clusters of conversation. My heart is beating faster than it should for just walking across a ballroom. This is David Sterling. I've faced him across debate podiums for two years. I've spent the last week in close proximity with him. There's no reason to be nervous.

Except everything has changed, and I'm about to walk up to him in front of both our teams and... what? Say congratulations? Ask if he wants to talk? Acknowledge the feelings we confessed a few hours ago?

I'm halfway to the Oakridge table when David looks up and sees me approaching. His expression shifts—surprise, then something warmer. He says something to Marcus, who glances my direction and grins knowingly, then excuses himself from the group and walks to meet me halfway.

We meet in the middle of the ballroom, surrounded by tournament noise and celebration, but it feels like we're in our own bubble.

"Hi," I say.

"Hi." He's still holding the championship trophy, and I notice his grip on it is uncertain, like he's not sure what to do with it. "You looked good up there. Accepting the finalist medal."

"You looked like you were born to hold that trophy."

"Did I?" He glances down at it. "I mostly felt like I was performing the role of 'championship winner' rather than actually being one."

"Still feeling hollow?"

"A bit less hollow than earlier." He meets my eyes. "Because earlier I talked to someone who made me realize that winning the trophy matters less than who I competed against."

My breath catches. We're standing in the middle of the awards ceremony reception, teams all around us, and David Sterling is looking at me like I'm the most important thing in the room.

"David—"

"Jordan, I know we said we'd figure this out, but I need to know—" He stops, seeming to gather courage. "Are you free tomorrow? Before we head back to Connecticut? Could we get breakfast or coffee or just... spend time together that isn't debate-related or surrounded by our teams?"

"Yes." The answer comes immediately. "Yes, I'd like that."

His smile is genuine, unguarded in a way I've rarely seen. "Good. Great. I'll text you in the morning and we can figure out logistics."

"Sounds perfect."

We're still standing there, neither quite ready to walk away, when Marcus appears at David's elbow. "Sorry to interrupt whatever this is, but Coach wants team photos with the trophy, and you're the one holding it."

"Right. Of course." David looks at me apologetically. "I should—"

"Go. Do the team photos. Celebrate with them. You earned it."

As he walks back to his table, Riley materializes beside me. "So? How'd it go?"

"We have breakfast plans tomorrow."

"Jordan Hayes is going on a breakfast date with David Sterling. I'm living in an alternate universe."

"It's not a date. It's just... breakfast."

"Uh huh. And I'm the queen of England."

I watch David pose for photos with his team, the championship trophy prominent, and I realize I'm smiling. I lost nationals. But somehow, impossibly, I don't feel like I lost anything at all.

I feel like I found exactly what I was looking for.
