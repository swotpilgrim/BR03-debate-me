# Chapter 8: First Hotel Night

By the time Coach Brennan pulls into the hotel parking lot, it's nearly seven PM and we've been on the road for over twelve hours with stops. Every muscle in my body aches from sitting, and I want nothing more than to escape this van and never see David Sterling again.

The hotel is a standard chain—three stories, exterior hallways, purely functional. But right now it looks like paradise.

"Finally," Amanda breathes as the van parks.

Everyone tumbles out, stiff and exhausted. I stretch my back and roll my shoulders, grateful for space that doesn't involve David Sterling three feet away.

I grab my duffel bag and follow Coach Brennan toward the lobby.

Check-in takes twenty minutes because coordinating rooms for twelve people always does. Coach Brennan handles the Wellington rooms while Professor Caldwell manages Oakridge's. I half-listen to the arrangements—coaches on the second floor, students on the third, boys and girls separated with rooms on opposite ends of the hallway.

"Room 307," Coach says, handing me a key card. "You're with Riley and Amanda."

I take the key gratefully. Riley appears at my elbow, looking as exhausted as I feel.

"First thing I'm doing is taking the longest shower of my life," she declares.

"Second thing I'm doing is lying face-down on a bed and not moving for twelve hours," I add.

We head for the elevator with our bags, passing the Oakridge students who are getting their room assignments. I carefully don't look at David, maintaining the civil distance Coach mandated.

Room 307 is standard—two double beds, small table, bathroom. But it has beds that aren't van seats, and that's all that matters.

Amanda claims one double bed. Riley and I take the other.

"I'm calling the shower first," Riley announces, already heading for the bathroom.

"Go ahead."

While Riley's in the shower, I unpack my duffel bag with methodical precision. Tomorrow's clothes, toiletries, phone charger, tournament prep materials. Everything has its place because organization is how I maintain control.

Amanda's on her bed, scrolling through her phone. "Did you see the group chat?" she asks.

"What group chat?"

"Marcus Chen made one. Combined Wellington and Oakridge. For coordinating logistics."

I feel a flash of annoyance. "When did that happen?"

"Like an hour ago. During the last stretch of driving." Amanda shows me her phone. Sure enough, there's a group message thread with all twelve students: *Road Trip Nationals Squad*.

"That's a terrible name," I mutter.

"Marcus Webb came up with it."

Of course he did. I scan through the messages—mostly discussion about dinner options near the hotel, some jokes about the drive, a surprising amount of friendly interaction between teams that were supposedly rivals a day ago.

My name appears in a message from Riley: *Jordan and David should coordinate captain stuff for tomorrow*

I'm going to kill her.

There's a knock on the door. Amanda bounces up to answer it, and Coach Brennan enters.

"Quick team check," she says. "Everyone settled in okay?"

"Yes, Coach," Amanda and I chorus.

Riley emerges from the bathroom in pajama pants and a t-shirt, toweling her hair. "Best shower ever."

Coach nods approvingly, then turns to me. "Jordan. I need you to coordinate with David Sterling about dinner logistics and tomorrow's departure plan."

"Why me?" I ask, though I know the answer.

"Because you're captains. Leadership responsibility includes boring administrative tasks." Coach's expression makes clear this isn't negotiable. "Meet in the lobby in ten minutes. Work it out like adults."

She leaves before I can protest further.

"This is your fault," I tell Riley.

"My fault? I didn't make you guys argue about snacks."

"You suggested captains coordinate in that group chat."

"Because captains should coordinate! That's literally what captains do!"

She's not wrong, but I'm still annoyed. I change into fresh clothes—jeans and a Wellington t-shirt—and head downstairs, leaving Riley and Amanda to debate shower order.

The lobby is mostly empty except for a few business travelers and one family checking in. I settle into a chair near the window and pull out my phone, preparing to make this as efficient and impersonal as possible.

David appears three minutes later.

He's changed too—jeans and an Oakridge t-shirt, his hair slightly damp like he also grabbed a quick shower. He spots me and walks over, his expression neutral and professional.

"Hayes," he says by way of greeting.

"Sterling."

We're using last names now, apparently. Fine by me.

"Coach said we need to coordinate logistics," I say, keeping my tone businesslike.

"Apparently." David sits in the chair across from mine, pulling out his phone. "Dinner first?"

"There's a pizza place two blocks away," I say, having already looked it up. "They can handle group orders. We could walk or see if the van's available."

"Walking would be better," David says. "Get everyone out of the van for a bit."

I nod, making a note. "What time?"

"Seven-thirty? Gives everyone time to settle in."

"Fine." I text the plan to the group chat. "Departure time tomorrow?"

This is where it gets tricky. I pull up the route details on my phone. "If we leave by seven, we'll hit DC around one, which gives us time to check into the tournament hotel and do preliminary prep before the welcome reception at five."

David's reviewing his own phone. "Seven's aggressive. What about seven-thirty? Still gets us there with enough time, but gives people a more reasonable wake-up."

"We don't need a leisurely morning. We need maximum prep time in DC."

"We need people who aren't exhausted before the tournament even starts," David counters.

I'm about to argue, but I catch myself. This is exactly what got us in trouble at the rest stop—turning every discussion into a battle. Coach's warning echoes: *maintain civil distance*.

I take a breath and actually consider his point. We drove twelve hours today. Another six tomorrow, plus navigating DC traffic and hotel check-in. If everyone's running on minimal sleep because I insisted on an early departure...

"Seven-thirty is reasonable," I concede.

David blinks, clearly surprised I agreed. "Okay. Seven-thirty."

I add it to my notes. "What about meals tomorrow? Same system—stop for lunch somewhere, or pack snacks?"

"Probably stop. Sitting for six hours straight isn't ideal."

We spend the next ten minutes working through details: rest stop locations, who's responsible for what materials, how to handle any issues that come up. It's weirdly civil. Still formal, still carefully impersonal, but we're actually communicating instead of fighting.

"I think that covers it," David says finally.

"Agreed."

We both stand. There's an awkward moment where we're just standing there, having completed our assigned task, unsure how to disengage.

"The rest stop thing was..." David starts, then stops, like he's not sure how to finish.

"Stupid," I supply.

"I was going to say 'unfortunate,' but stupid works."

"We probably shouldn't argue about snacks anymore."

"Probably not."

It's not an apology—we already did the forced apology outside the convenience store. But it's an acknowledgment that yes, that was ridiculous, and maybe we could try being less ridiculous.

"I'm going back upstairs," I say.

"Yeah. I'll send the schedule to the group chat."

I head for the elevator, but something makes me glance back. David's still in the lobby, looking at his phone, and for just a second, he looks tired. Not composed and perfect—just tired.

Then he looks up, catches me watching, and the careful mask slides back into place.

I turn away and step into the elevator.

Back in room 307, Riley and Amanda are both showered and are debating what to wear to dinner.

"How'd it go?" Riley asks with entirely too much interest.

"Fine. We made a schedule like functional adults."

"Any arguments?"

"No."

"Did you apologize for the snack incident?"

"We acknowledged it was stupid. Close enough."

Riley grins. "Progress."

"It's not progress. It's two people coordinating basic logistics."

"Two people who were screaming at each other about potato chips this morning," Amanda points out.

"We weren't screaming—"

"You were definitely screaming," Riley says. "Marcus told me people in the parking lot were staring."

I groan and flop onto the bed. "This trip is a disaster."

"It's been one day," Riley says. "You survived. That's progress."

At seven-thirty, both teams meet in the lobby and walk together to the pizza place. The teams naturally mix more than this morning—Wellington and Oakridge students walking together in small groups, the artificial divide starting to blur.

David and I maintain distance, staying with our respective teams, but it's less hostile than this morning. More like mutual agreement to not engage rather than active avoidance.

The pizza place is busy but accommodating. We push tables together and order several large pizzas.

"To surviving day one," Marcus Webb says, raising his soda cup.

"To not killing each other," Riley adds.

Everyone laughs and toasts with their drinks. It's almost normal—just a group of students on a trip, sharing a meal, talking about the tournament ahead.

Across the table, David catches my eye for a second. Neither of us smiles, but there's something there—acknowledgment, maybe. We survived day one. We coordinated logistics without drawing blood. Small victories.

The pizza arrives, and conversation flows. People share stories about past tournaments, debate disasters, funny judge moments. The teams aren't Wellington and Oakridge anymore—they're just debaters who happen to go to different schools.

But I notice David Sterling is quieter than the others. He participates when directly addressed but mostly listens, observing rather than engaging fully. I wonder if he's as exhausted by this forced camaraderie as I am.

We walk back to the hotel around nine, full of pizza and marginally less hostile than this morning. Coach Brennan announces lights out by ten—tomorrow's another long drive.

Back in room 307, I set my alarm for six-fifteen and climb into bed. Riley and Amanda are already half-asleep.

I lie in the darkness, listening to unfamiliar hotel sounds—doors closing, the ice machine, air conditioning hum.

One day down. Two more days until we reach nationals.

I can do this. I'm surviving. David Sterling and I managed an entire logistics meeting without fighting. That has to count for something.

My phone buzzes with a message. The group chat.

David has posted tomorrow's schedule with departure time, planned rest stop, estimated arrival in DC.

Riley sent back a thumbs up emoji.

I add my own thumbs up, feeling ridiculous but committed to this new era of professional coordination.

Then I turn off my phone and close my eyes.

Tomorrow: six hours in the van, arrival in DC, tournament prep.

Tomorrow: one day closer to nationals and one day closer to the end of this uncomfortable proximity with David Sterling.

I can survive this.

I will survive this.
