# Chapter 5: The Forced Solution

Coach Brennan's call comes the next evening while I'm in my dorm room, halfheartedly attempting to study for a calculus test I can barely bring myself to care about. When her name appears on my phone screen, my heart rate spikes.

"Coach?" I answer, sitting up straight on my bed.

"Jordan. I have news." Her voice is careful, measured—the tone she uses when she's about to say something she knows I won't like. "Can you come to my office? This is better discussed in person."

"Just tell me," I say, gripping the phone tighter. "Is it good news or bad news?"

There's a pause. "It's... complicated news."

Ten minutes later, I'm back in Coach Brennan's office. She's still surrounded by budget spreadsheets and what looks like email printouts, but her expression is different than yesterday—less defeated, more cautiously optimistic.

"I've been in contact with the New England Debate Consortium all day," she begins. "I explained our situation—the budget crisis, the timing, the fact that we qualified but can't afford to attend. I wasn't the only coach making desperate calls."

"Oakridge?" I guess immediately.

She nods. "Professor Caldwell at Oakridge Prep reached out to the consortium with the same problem. Different circumstances—their endowment took losses this quarter too—but the same result. Both schools have qualified teams and no travel funding."

I lean forward. "So what did the consortium say?"

"They proposed a solution." Coach Brennan pulls out a printed email and slides it across the desk. "A joint travel arrangement. Wellington Hall and Oakridge Prep would share transportation and accommodation costs. One van, one hotel block, split expenses between both schools."

The words register, but my brain refuses to process their meaning.

"Share transportation," I repeat slowly. "With Oakridge."

"With Oakridge," Coach Brennan confirms.

"You mean... we would travel to Washington together. In the same van. For two days."

"Yes."

"Coach." I'm shaking my head before I finish speaking. "No. Absolutely not. That's—we can't—"

"Jordan—"

"We're rivals," I interrupt. "Wellington and Oakridge have been competing against each other for years. We're supposed to travel together to nationals? Spend six hundred miles trapped in a van with them? With David Sterling?"

Coach Brennan's expression doesn't change. "That's the proposal, yes."

"It's a terrible proposal."

"It's the only proposal that allows both teams to attend nationals," she says firmly. "The consortium worked with the schools to calculate shared costs. Van rental, gas, hotels, registration—split between two programs instead of one. Each school would only need to contribute approximately twenty-three hundred dollars."

The number stops me mid-protest. Twenty-three hundred dollars is still a lot of money, but it's less than half of what we needed yesterday. It's actually... potentially achievable.

"The finance committee approved this budget," Coach Brennan continues. "With shared costs, they're willing to fund the trip. But only if both schools commit to the joint arrangement."

"So if we say no—"

"If either school says no, the arrangement falls through and neither team goes to nationals."

The weight of that settles over me like a physical thing. This isn't just about my pride or my discomfort with David Sterling. This is about the entire Wellington debate team. Riley, Amanda, Marcus, Liam—all the people who've worked just as hard as I have for this opportunity.

"What did Oakridge say?" I ask.

"Professor Caldwell is presenting the proposal to his team tonight. He indicated they would likely accept, given that the alternative is missing nationals entirely."

Of course Oakridge would accept. They're probably just as desperate as we are. And knowing David Sterling, he'd rather endure two days with Wellington than give up his chance at nationals glory.

"I need your input as team captain," Coach Brennan says. "This affects the entire team, but you're the one who'll need to manage group dynamics on the trip. If you genuinely believe this arrangement would be detrimental to our team's performance—"

"It wouldn't be detrimental," I interrupt, because I have to be honest. "It would be... uncomfortable. Awkward. But we'd still get to nationals."

"That's what I thought." Coach Brennan leans back in her chair. "Look, Jordan. I know you and David Sterling have a complicated competitive history. But this is bigger than individual rivalries. This is about giving six students from each school the opportunity to compete at the national level. Can you put aside personal feelings for three days of travel?"

The question feels like a challenge. Like she's asking if I'm mature enough, professional enough, to prioritize the team over my own discomfort.

"Yes," I say, because what else can I say? "If this is how we get to nationals, then fine. We'll make it work."

Coach Brennan nods, looking relieved. "I'll confirm with the consortium. The travel arrangements will be coordinated between both schools. Departure is Friday morning—both teams meet at Wellington's parking lot at six AM, van leaves at six-thirty."

"Wellington's parking lot?" I ask. "Why here?"

"It's a midpoint between schools, and the van rental company is local to this area. Oakridge will drive their team here Friday morning, and we'll all depart together."

The image forms unwillingly in my mind: David Sterling and the Oakridge Prep debate team pulling into Wellington's parking lot. Crossing onto our campus. Climbing into a van with us for six hundred miles of forced proximity.

"This is going to be a disaster," I say aloud.

"Or," Coach Brennan counters, "it's going to be an opportunity to prove Wellington can maintain professionalism and composure even in challenging circumstances. Which will you make it?"

It's a very coach thing to say—turning every obstacle into a character-building opportunity. But she's not wrong. If I approach this trip like it's a disaster, it will be. If I can somehow convince myself it's just logistics, just transportation, just three days before the real competition begins...

"I'll talk to the team," I say. "Make sure everyone's on board."

"Thank you." Coach Brennan stands, extending her hand across the desk. "I know this isn't ideal, Jordan. But we're going to nationals. Focus on that."

I shake her hand and leave the office, my mind spinning.

By the time I get back to my dorm, I've composed and deleted approximately seven different text messages to Riley. None of them adequately capture the surreal nightmare of what I just agreed to.

Instead of texting, I call.

Riley answers on the second ring. "Please tell me Coach found a solution."

"She found a solution," I confirm, closing my dorm room door and sinking onto my bed. "It's the worst solution imaginable, but it's a solution."

"How bad are we talking?"

"We're traveling to nationals with Oakridge Prep."

Silence. Then: "I'm sorry, what?"

"Shared van. Shared hotels. Shared costs. Wellington and Oakridge, together for the entire trip."

"You're joking."

"I wish I were joking."

Riley's laugh is slightly hysterical. "Jordan. You and David Sterling are going to be trapped in a van for six hundred miles. You realize this, right?"

"Very aware, thanks."

"You're going to kill each other before we even get to DC."

"Probably," I agree. "But at least we'll get to nationals first."

Riley's quiet for a moment, processing. "Okay. So we're really doing this. Wellington and Oakridge, road trip buddies."

"Apparently."

"How are you feeling about it?"

It's such a Riley question—checking in on my emotional state when most people would focus on the logistics. I consider lying, but Riley always knows when I'm lying.

"I hate it," I admit. "I hate that our only option to get to nationals involves spending two days with David Sterling. I hate that Oakridge is going to see our team on our campus, in our space. I hate that this trip is going to be awkward and tense and miserable."

"But?" Riley prompts, because she can hear there's a but coming.

"But I want to go to nationals more than I hate this arrangement," I finish. "So I guess I'm learning to live with it."

"That's very mature of you."

"I don't feel mature. I feel like I'm compromising everything just to get on that stage."

"You're not compromising," Riley says firmly. "You're being practical. There's a difference. And honestly? Maybe this won't be as terrible as you think. Oakridge debaters are still just students. They're probably just as uncomfortable with this as we are."

I think about David Sterling, with his composed confidence and perfect Sterling legacy. "I doubt David Sterling is uncomfortable with anything."

"Maybe you'd be surprised."

"Unlikely."

Riley laughs. "Okay, but seriously. Ground rules for the trip. We need to establish some. Like, are we sitting with them? Eating meals together? Pretending to be friendly?"

"I have no idea," I admit. "Coach said we need to maintain professionalism. Which I assume means not starting fights or sabotaging their debate prep."

"The bar is so low."

"And yet I'm worried we won't clear it."

We spend the next twenty minutes discussing strategy—not debate strategy, but survival strategy. How to coexist with Oakridge for three days without losing our minds. By the time we hang up, I feel slightly more prepared for what's coming.

But only slightly.

I lie back on my bed and stare at the ceiling. The nationals announcement is still pinned above my desk, visible in my peripheral vision.

*National Debate Championship
Capital Convention Center, Washington, DC*

Eleven days from now, I'll be standing on that stage. Competing at the highest level. Maybe—probably—facing David Sterling in a round that actually matters.

But first, I have to survive six hundred miles in a van with him.

I grab my phone and send a message to the team group chat: *We're going to nationals. Joint trip with Oakridge. Meeting tomorrow to discuss details. Prepare yourselves.*

The responses come immediately:

*WAIT WHAT* —Amanda

*This is going to be interesting* —Marcus

*Define "joint trip"* —Liam

*I'll explain tomorrow* I reply. *For now, just know we're going. That's what matters.*

Riley sends a private message: *You okay?*

*I will be* I respond. *Once this trip is over and we're at nationals where we belong.*

*That's the spirit*

I set my phone down and close my eyes, trying to visualize the trip. Not the awkward parts, not the forced proximity with David Sterling, but the destination. Washington, DC. The convention center. The tournament rounds. The moment when all of this discomfort and compromise will be worth it.

I can survive three days of travel if it means getting my shot at nationals.

I have to.
