# Chapter 14: Seeing Each Other Differently

My third preliminary round is at two-thirty, and by three-fifteen, I know I've won.

The judges deliberate longer—my opponent from Texas had sharp cross-examination skills—but when they announce Wellington Hall, the relief is overwhelming.

Three for three. I'm advancing to semifinals.

I exit the conference room on an adrenaline high. Riley's waiting and squeals when she sees my face.

"You won."

"All three prelims. I'm through to semis."

We hug, and the enormity hits me. I'm competing in the national championship semifinals. I made it to the top sixteen in the country.

"Coach is going to be so proud," Riley says. "The whole team's been winning. I think we all advanced."

We head back toward the main convention area where the rest of Wellington is gathering. Everyone's buzzing with success—Marcus won all three, Liam won two of three, Amanda went two for three. By the time Coach Brennan gets the full report, Wellington Hall has five students advancing to semifinals.

"Outstanding work," Coach says, genuine pride in her voice. "Tomorrow's semifinals are at nine AM. That gives you tonight to rest and prepare. But for now, celebrate. You earned this."

The team decides to grab dinner together, but I'm too wired to eat immediately. "I need to walk," I tell Riley. "Clear my head, process everything. I'll meet you at the restaurant in an hour?"

"You sure?"

"Yeah. Just need some air."

Riley nods, understanding. She knows me well enough to know when I need space to think.

I wander through the convention center, still buzzing with activity. Preliminary rounds are wrapping up—tomorrow the field narrows to sixteen for semifinals.

And I'm one of them.

Heading toward the glass walkway connecting to the hotel, I pass a conference room with its door closed but window visible.

Inside, a round is still happening. At the far podium is David Sterling.

I should keep walking. Watching David compete isn't productive.

But I stop anyway.

Through the window, I can see David at his podium, focused and intense. His opponent—someone from a Midwest school—looks tired, like the round has been grueling. The judges are taking extensive notes.

I can't hear what David's saying, but I can read his body language. He's in full debate mode—gestures precise, posture confident, complete command of the room. This is David Sterling at his best, and even through glass, it's impressive.

But I'm also noticing things I never saw when I was his opponent.

The way he runs his hand through his hair when he's thinking hard, making a quick note before continuing his argument. The slight smile that appears when he lands a particularly strong point—not smug, just satisfied with a well-executed strategy. The intensity in his expression when he's fully engaged, like nothing exists except this debate, this moment, this competition.

He's not performing excellence. He's genuinely living it.

The judges confer. Even from outside, I can tell it was a close round—lots of discussion, checking scorecards, comparing notes. Then the head judge announces the decision.

Oakridge Prep.

David won.

He thanks the judges with professional courtesy, shakes his opponent's hand, gathers his materials. The round concludes, and participants start filing out.

I should leave before he sees me. This is weird—standing outside his round like some kind of stalker.

But I don't move.

David exits the conference room, debate case in hand, looking exhausted but satisfied. He's three steps into the hallway when he notices me standing near the window.

We both freeze.

"Hayes," he says, surprise evident in his voice.

"Sterling."

"Were you—" He glances back at the conference room. "Were you watching my round?"

There's no point lying. "I was walking past. Saw you through the window."

"And stopped to watch."

"For a minute."

David's expression is unreadable. "That's either strategic intelligence gathering or you're interested in my debate technique for other reasons."

"Strategic intelligence," I say quickly, even though I'm not sure that's entirely true.

"Right." He doesn't sound convinced. "How'd your prelims go?"

"Three for three. Made semifinals."

"Congratulations." He says it like he means it, which is disorienting. "I went three for three too. Semis tomorrow."

"Congratulations."

We're standing in the convention center hallway, in our formal debate attire, both exhausted from a day of competition, congratulating each other like colleagues instead of rivals. It's surreal.

"I should—" I gesture vaguely toward the hotel connection.

"Yeah, me too."

But neither of us moves.

"That last round looked intense," I say, not sure why I'm continuing the conversation.

"It was. My opponent had a really strong policy framework. I barely countered it in time." David shifts his debate case to his other hand. "Your third round? How was that?"

"Texas team with sharp cross-examination. She found weaknesses in my argumentation I didn't know I had."

"But you still won."

"Barely."

"Winning barely still counts."

We start walking toward the hotel together—not a conscious decision, just natural movement in the same direction. The glass walkway connecting convention center to hotel is quieter than the main spaces, with fewer people around.

"Can I ask you something?" David says after a few moments of silence.

"Depends on the question."

"Does nationals feel different than you expected?"

The question surprises me with its vulnerability. "Yeah. More pressure. Everything feels higher stakes."

"Exactly." David looks relieved that I understand. "I thought I was prepared. I've been to big tournaments before. But this is different."

"Because it's nationals."

"Because it's nationals," he agrees. "And because..." He trails off, like he's not sure he should finish the thought.

"Because what?"

"Because my entire family has won nationals. My father, both my brothers. The Sterling legacy is that we win when it matters most." He says it without emotion, just stating a fact, but I hear the weight underneath. "So yes, it feels different. It feels like if I don't win, I've broken a family tradition that goes back thirty years."

I've spent two years resenting David Sterling's privilege—his legacy status, his family name, his apparently effortless excellence. But standing here, listening to him admit the crushing weight of expectation, I realize privilege comes with its own kind of prison.

"I get it," I say quietly. "Different circumstances, but I get it. I'm the only scholarship student from Wellington competing at nationals. Every round I win validates that I deserve to be here. Every round I lose confirms what people assumed—that I only got this far because of luck or financial aid quotas."

David looks at me, really looks at me, and I see recognition in his expression. "So we're both carrying pressure that has nothing to do with the actual competition."

"Everything to do with the actual competition," I correct. "But yes. External pressure on top of internal drive."

We've reached the hotel lobby. Around us, debaters are gathering for dinners or heading to rooms to prepare. Our teams are probably looking for us.

But we're still standing here, in this moment of unexpected honesty.

"For what it's worth," David says, "you deserve to be here. Not because of financial aid or quotas or luck. Because you're one of the best debaters in the country. I've known that since our first competition two years ago."

The compliment lands with unexpected impact. "You never acted like you thought I was good."

"I never acted like I thought you were anything except my fiercest competition. That's not the same as not respecting your skill."

I think about all our confrontations—the cold interactions, the hostile rounds, the two years of rivalry. And I realize he's right. David never dismissed me. He always treated me like a threat, like someone worth his full attention and effort.

That was its own kind of respect.

"You're better than your family legacy," I tell him. "You're not winning nationals because you're a Sterling. If you win, it's because you worked for it and earned it on your own merit."

David's expression shifts—surprise, maybe gratitude. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. I still plan to beat you if we meet in finals."

"When we meet in finals," he corrects, echoing our earlier conversation. "And you can try."

We're both smiling now, and it's strange how this feels less like animosity and more like... partnership? Understanding wrapped in competitive drive?

"I should find my team," I say. "Dinner plans."

"Same. Oakridge is probably wondering where I disappeared to."

But we both linger for another moment.

"Tomorrow's semifinals," David says. "We're both in the top sixteen now. One step closer."

"One step closer to finals."

"Where we'll finally determine which of us is actually better."

"I already know which of us is better," I say.

"So do I," David counters.

"Then finals will just confirm it."

"Looking forward to it."

We're back to our competitive banter, but it feels different now. Less hostile, more... playful? Like we're both in on the same joke.

"See you tomorrow, Sterling."

"See you tomorrow, Hayes."

He heads toward the elevators, and I walk toward the restaurant where Wellington is meeting for dinner. But I glance back once and catch David doing the same thing—both of us looking back at the other before turning away.

When I reach the restaurant, Riley takes one look at my face and grins.

"You ran into David."

"How did you—"

"You have that look. What happened?"

I slide into the booth. "We talked. About nationals pressure and expectations. It was... normal."

"Normal," Riley repeats. "You and David Sterling had a normal conversation."

"A week ago you were murdering each other over potato chips. Now heartfelt conversations. That's character development."

"It's two competitors who understand what this tournament means."

"Sure," Riley says, clearly thinking it's much more than that.

I ignore her and focus on the menu, trying to push thoughts of David Sterling out of my mind. Tomorrow is semifinals. Sixteen teams competing for eight spots in finals. That's where my focus needs to be—not on unexpected conversations in hotel lobbies or the way David looked when he admitted his family pressure.

But as dinner conversation flows around me, I keep thinking about standing in that hallway with David, both of us being honest about fear and pressure for the first time.

Something shifted today. Something changed in how I see him—not just as an opponent or a rival, but as a person who carries his own weight, who works just as hard as I do, who wants victory just as desperately.

And that makes tomorrow's competition both more exciting and more complicated than I expected.
