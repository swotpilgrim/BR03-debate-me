# Chapter 27: The Kiss

The van reaches the overnight hotel in New Jersey around 9 PM. Both teams are exhausted, and check-in is efficient—everyone just wants to sleep before the final leg home tomorrow.

I'm sharing with Riley and Amanda again. After we unpack and change into comfortable clothes, Amanda crashes immediately, asleep before her head hits the pillow.

Riley sits on her bed, looking at me knowingly. "You're not going to sleep, are you?"

"Probably not for a while."

"Jordan." She grins. "Go find him. Stop pretending you're fine going to bed early when you're clearly thinking about him."

"Am I that obvious?"

"You've been obvious since Delaware where you came back holding hands. Go. I'll cover for you if Amanda wakes up."

"Thank you."

"Just keep it PG. Kissing only."

My face heats up. "We haven't—"

"Yet. Make it a good one."

I grab my room key and phone, pull a Wellington hoodie over my t-shirt, and slip out into the hallway. It's almost 11 PM, and the hotel is quiet—most teams already asleep or settled in for the night.

I head down to the lobby. When I reach it, David's already there, sitting in a corner armchair, wearing Oakridge sweatpants and a hoodie.

He looks up, expression shifting to something warm. "I was hoping you'd come down."

"How did you know I would?"

"Because I couldn't sleep thinking about you." He stands, pocketing his phone. "Also, Marcus bet me five dollars you'd be here within twenty minutes."

I laugh. "Marcus is too perceptive."

"Tell me about it."

The lobby is nearly empty—just a tired desk clerk and one late-arriving family. David and I gravitate toward a quieter corner.

We sit in adjacent armchairs, and for a moment neither speaks. Tomorrow we go back to Connecticut and everything changes.

"Tomorrow we go home," I finally say.

"Tomorrow everything goes back to normal," David agrees. "Except it won't be normal anymore, will it?"

"No. It won't." I pull my knees up onto the chair, wrapping my arms around them. "David, I need to know this is real. That when we're back at our schools and nationals is over, you're not going to disappear or decide this was just a tournament thing that made sense in the moment but doesn't work in reality."

He leans forward, elbows on his knees, looking at me intently. "Jordan. Look at me."

I do.

"This is real," he says, and his voice is completely serious. "What I feel for you is real. It's not about nationals or proximity or being caught up in competition. It's about you—who you are, how you challenge me, how you make me better. That doesn't disappear when we get back to Connecticut."

"How do you know?"

"Because I've been falling for you since you argued with me about van snacks at that first rest stop, and nationals is almost over and I'm still falling."

My breath catches. "That was only a week ago."

"A week of proximity and conversation and getting to know you as Jordan, not just my debate opponent." He reaches across the space between our chairs, and his hand finds mine. "A week of realizing that the person I've been obsessed with beating is actually the person I want beside me. Not across from me at a podium, but actually beside me. With me."

"I want that too," I say quietly. "But I'm scared."

"Of what?"

"Of this not working. Of the distance being too hard. Of us trying and failing and losing what we have." I squeeze his hand. "David, you're not just someone I'm falling for. You're the person who's seen me at my most competitive and most vulnerable. You know me in ways no one else does. If this doesn't work, if we try and it falls apart, I don't just lose a boyfriend. I lose my equal."

"Then we don't let it fall apart." His thumb traces circles on the back of my hand. "Jordan, I don't have a guarantee this will work. I can't promise the distance won't be hard or that college won't complicate things. But I can promise I'm going to try. Actually try, not just say I'll stay in touch and then let it fade. I want this. I want us."

"So do I."

We're sitting close now, both leaning forward in our chairs, hands linked between us. The lobby feels far away, like we're in our own bubble of space and time where it's just us figuring out what we are to each other.

"Can I tell you something?" David says.

"Always."

"I don't want tonight to end with uncertainty about what we are. I don't want to get back to Connecticut tomorrow and spend the next week wondering if you're feeling the same way I am, if this is real for you the way it is for me."

"It is real for me."

"Then let's be clear about it. Let's commit to trying this, to being together, to figuring out how to make it work."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yes. Okay. I want to try this with you. I want to be with you and figure out what that means and navigate the complications together."

David's smile is beautiful, relieved and happy and unguarded. "I was really hoping you'd say that."

"Were you worried I wouldn't?"

"A little. You're good at protecting yourself. I thought you might decide this was too risky."

"It is too risky," I admit. "But you're worth the risk."

We sit there for a moment, both processing what we just committed to. We're really doing this. David Sterling and Jordan Hayes, former rivals, trying to be something more.

David stands up, pulling me to my feet with him. "Come on. Let's find somewhere a little more private than the lobby."

We move to a quieter hallway alcove, away from the desk clerk's line of sight, just the two of us in a small space with dim lighting and no other people around.

"Jordan," David says, and there's something in his voice that makes my heart race. "I want to kiss you. I've wanted to kiss you since the rest stop in Delaware, maybe even before that. But I need to know if that's okay. If you want that too."

My heart is hammering so hard I'm sure he can hear it. "I want that too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

He steps closer, one hand coming up to cup my cheek, and I can see the different colors in his eyes this close—brown with flecks of gold, made softer by the dim lighting. His thumb brushes across my cheekbone, and the gesture is so gentle it makes my chest ache.

"Tell me if you want me to stop," he says quietly.

"I won't want you to stop."

He leans in slowly, giving me time to change my mind, to pull away, to decide this is too much too fast. But I don't want to pull away. I meet him halfway, rising up on my toes, and then his lips are on mine.

The kiss is tentative at first—soft, questioning, both of us nervous despite wanting this. But then my hand comes up to rest against his chest, and his other hand finds my waist, and the kiss deepens just slightly. It's sweet and perfect and makes me feel like my entire body is lighting up from the inside.

When we finally pull apart, we're both a little breathless, both smiling, both aware that everything just changed again.

"Wow," David says.

"Yeah. Wow."

We stand close together in the hallway alcove, foreheads almost touching, both processing what just happened.

"That was my first kiss," I admit quietly.

David's eyes widen slightly. "Really?"

"Really. I've been too busy with debate to date. You?"

"Second. There was someone freshman year for like two weeks, but it didn't mean anything." He pauses. "This means something."

"Yeah. It does."

We stand there a moment longer, neither quite ready to let go of this moment, of the privacy and closeness and the new reality that we just kissed and it was perfect.

"I should get back to my room," I finally say. "Before Riley sends out a search party."

"And I should get back before Marcus starts making assumptions and texting the entire Oakridge team."

"He'd do that?"

"Absolutely. He's been rooting for this since day one of the road trip."

I laugh. "Riley too. She's going to have so many questions when I get back."

We walk back to the elevator together, and when the doors open, we both step inside. David presses the button for my floor first, then his.

The elevator rises slowly. At the fifth floor, the doors open, and I start to step out, but David catches my hand.

"Jordan?"

"Yeah?"

"Sweet dreams."

"You too."

He leans in and kisses me again, briefly, sweetly, and then lets me go. I step out into the hallway, and the elevator doors close, carrying him up to the sixth floor.

I walk back to my room in a daze, let myself in quietly, and find Riley still awake, sitting up in bed with a book.

"Well?" she whispers.

I sit on my bed, facing her, and I can feel the smile on my face. "We kissed."

"FINALLY." Then quieter when Amanda stirs: "I mean, finally. Took you long enough."

"Riley—"

"Was it good?"

"It was perfect."

"And you're together now? Like, officially?"

"Yeah. We're going to try this. Actually try to make it work."

Riley grins. "I'm happy for you, Jordan. You deserve this. You deserve someone who sees how amazing you are and isn't intimidated by it."

"He's pretty amazing too."

"I know. I've been watching you two dance around each other all week. I'm just glad you finally figured it out."

I get ready for bed, change into pajamas, and climb under the covers. But before I turn off the light, my phone buzzes with a text.

David: *Made it back to my room. Already missing you.*

I text back: *Same. See you tomorrow.*

David: *Can't wait.*

I put my phone on the nightstand and turn off the light, but I'm smiling in the dark. Tomorrow we go back to Connecticut, to separate schools, to reality. But tonight, in this hotel in New Jersey, David Sterling kissed me and told me this was real.

And lying here in the quiet darkness, I believe him.

Whatever happens next, whatever complications come, we're facing them together. Not as rivals. Not as opponents.

As something infinitely better.

As us.
