# Chapter 7: Rest Stop Disaster

The rest stop appears like an oasis after three hours of van captivity. Coach Brennan pulls into the parking area, and I've never been so grateful to see a generic highway service plaza in my life.

"Thirty minutes," Coach announces as she puts the van in park. "Bathroom breaks, stretch your legs, grab food if you want. We meet back here at nine-thirty sharp."

The doors open and everyone spills out. I practically leap from the back row, desperate for space that isn't shared with David Sterling. My legs are stiff from sitting, and the morning air is cool and sharp—perfect after the van's recycled warmth.

"Freedom," Riley declares dramatically, stretching her arms overhead.

"For thirty minutes," I remind her.

"I'll take what I can get."

The rest stop is moderately crowded with other travelers—families with young kids, business people grabbing coffee, truckers taking breaks. Our group of twelve debate students probably looks ridiculous, all wearing our school hoodies like some kind of academic gang.

"I'm going to the bathroom," Amanda announces, and several other students follow.

I head toward the convenience store portion of the rest stop, having spotted the coffee station through the windows. After three hours of hostile silence in the back row, I need caffeine.

The store is generic travel plaza standard: racks of snacks, coolers with drinks, a sad-looking hot dog roller, and a self-serve coffee station that's seen better days. I grab the largest cup available and fill it with something claiming to be French roast.

I'm adding sugar when someone reaches past me for a coffee cup.

I know it's David Sterling before I even turn around. Some instinct, or maybe just bad luck.

"Excuse me," he says, his tone perfectly polite and impersonal.

I step aside without responding, focusing intently on my coffee like it requires my complete attention.

We stand next to each other at the coffee station—him filling his cup, me adding cream to mine—in silence that somehow feels louder than conversation. I'm acutely aware of how close we are, closer than we've been since we were at opposite podiums at regionals.

I finish first and head toward the register, ready to pay and escape this interaction.

The line at checkout is short—just one person ahead of me. I wait, coffee in one hand, phone in the other, trying to project that I'm completely unaware of David Sterling standing behind me in line.

Then Riley appears, carrying an armful of snacks.

"I'm getting van supplies," she announces, dumping bags of chips and packages of cookies onto the counter when it's our turn. "We should contribute to shared snacks, right?"

"Sure," I say, pulling out my wallet.

"Actually," a voice says behind us, "Oakridge was planning to handle van snacks."

I turn. David's standing there with his own collection of snack bags, and behind him, Marcus Webb is carrying drinks.

"We were here first," I say before I can stop myself.

David's eyebrow raises slightly. "I don't think the convenience store operates on a first-come basis for van provisions."

"I'm not—" I start, then stop, because I'm about to argue about something completely ridiculous. "Never mind. Buy your snacks."

"We will," David says, and there's an edge to his voice now. "Unless Wellington would like to claim territorial rights to all rest stop purchases?"

Riley shoots me a warning look, but I ignore it.

"That's not what I said."

"You implied it."

"I implied that we were already buying snacks, so your purchase is redundant."

"Or," David counters, "your purchase is redundant since Oakridge was already planning to contribute."

We're standing in the middle of a highway rest stop convenience store, arguing about bags of chips, and I'm aware of how insane this is. But I can't seem to stop.

"This is ridiculous," I say. "It's five dollars' worth of snacks."

"Then why are you making it an issue?"

"I'm not making it an issue. You're making it an issue by suggesting—"

"Suggesting what? That Oakridge might also contribute to group supplies? How unreasonable."

His tone is maddeningly calm, like he's in a debate round and I'm an opponent making weak arguments. It sets my teeth on edge.

"You're trying to establish some kind of dominance by providing snacks," I say, and the words sound absurd even as I'm saying them.

"Or," David says, his voice dropping lower and taking on that debate-mode precision, "I'm trying to be a considerate travel companion, and you're projecting your competitive hostility onto a completely neutral gesture."

"It's not neutral when—"

"When what? When it comes from Oakridge? When it comes from me?"

We're standing too close now, neither of us backing down. Riley has literally abandoned the snacks on the counter and is staring at us in horror. Marcus Webb has appeared next to David, looking equally alarmed.

"You're impossible," I say.

"You're paranoid," David shoots back.

"Okay!" Riley grabs my arm and physically pulls me away from David. "Jordan. Outside. Now."

"But the—"

"Marcus will get the snacks," Riley says firmly, already steering me toward the exit. "You need air."

Behind us, I hear Marcus Webb saying something similar to David in a low, urgent voice.

Riley drags me outside to a bench near the entrance and makes me sit.

"What," she says slowly, "was that?"

"He started it."

"Jordan. You were arguing about chips."

"He implied—"

"He implied nothing. You both walked into that store determined to find something to fight about, and you succeeded. Congratulations."

I slump back against the bench, the adrenaline of the confrontation draining away and leaving embarrassment in its wake.

"It's been three hours," Riley continues. "Three hours into a three-day trip, and you're already fighting in public about snack food."

"I know."

"Do you? Because Coach Brennan's going to hear about this, and she's going to be pissed."

As if summoned by prophecy, Coach Brennan appears from the direction of the van, her expression thunderous. Professor Caldwell is with her, looking equally displeased.

"Jordan Hayes," Coach says. "Professor Caldwell's office. Now."

I blink. "We don't have an office. We're at a rest stop."

"The bench over there," she clarifies, pointing to a different bench far from other people. "Move."

I stand and walk to the designated bench. David's already there, having apparently received the same summons. We sit on opposite ends, not looking at each other.

Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell stand in front of us like disappointed parents.

"I'm going to ask this once," Coach says. "What happened in there?"

David and I both start talking at once.

"He implied—"

"She suggested—"

"Stop," Professor Caldwell says firmly. "One at a time. David?"

David's jaw tightens. "We both attempted to purchase snacks for the van. Hayes took offense at Oakridge contributing."

"That's not—" I start, but Coach holds up her hand.

"Jordan?"

"I didn't take offense at Oakridge contributing," I say carefully. "I took offense at his attitude about it."

"My attitude," David repeats, "was perfectly civil."

"It was condescending."

"It was practical."

"It was—"

"Enough," Coach Brennan cuts us off. "I don't care who started it or what the actual substance of your argument was. We are four hours into a three-day trip. Four hours. And you two are already creating scenes in public places."

"This reflects poorly on both schools," Professor Caldwell adds. "You are captains. You represent your teams and your institutions. This behavior is unacceptable."

The word "unacceptable" lands with weight. I feel my face heating with embarrassment and anger—anger at David for baiting me, anger at myself for taking the bait.

"Apologize to each other," Coach says. "Now."

I look at David. He's staring straight ahead, his expression stony.

"I apologize," I say stiffly, "for creating a scene."

"I apologize as well," David says in the same formal tone.

"Look at each other when you say it," Professor Caldwell instructs.

This is humiliating. I turn toward David. He turns toward me. Our eyes meet.

"I apologize," I repeat.

"I apologize," David echoes.

We're both lying, and everyone knows it, but apparently the performance of contrition is enough.

"Better," Coach says, though she doesn't sound convinced. "For the remainder of this trip, you will maintain a civil distance from each other. No arguments, no debates about logistics, no engagement unless absolutely necessary. Do you understand?"

"Yes," we say in unison.

"Good. Get back to the van."

David stands and walks away without looking at me. I wait a few seconds before following, maintaining the required civil distance.

Riley's waiting near the van with the snacks—both my purchase and apparently David's—in bags.

"You okay?" she asks quietly.

"I'm a professional debater who just got reprimanded like a five-year-old for fighting about potato chips," I say. "I'm fantastic."

"It could be worse."

"How?"

"We still have eleven hours of driving today."

I groan and climb back into the van. The other students are already settled in their seats, and there's an awkward awareness in the air—everyone clearly heard about the convenience store incident.

I make my way to the back row and reclaim my window seat. David's already in his spot, staring at his phone with fierce concentration.

The middle seat between us feels like a demilitarized zone.

Coach Brennan gets in the driver's seat and addresses the van without turning around.

"We're going to spend the rest of this drive remembering that we're all on the same side—getting to nationals. Personal rivalries stay off this van. Understood?"

A chorus of "Yes, Coach" and "Yes, Professor" fills the vehicle.

The van pulls back onto the highway, and we resume our journey south.

In the back row, David Sterling and I maintain our hostile silence, now with the added humiliation of having been publicly scolded.

This trip just keeps getting better.

I put my headphones back in, close my eyes, and try to pretend I'm anywhere else.

But I'm hyperaware of David's presence across the aisle, and the uncomfortable truth settling in my chest: if I can't survive a thirty-minute rest stop without fighting with him, how am I possibly going to survive two more days?
