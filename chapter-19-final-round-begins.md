# Chapter 19: The Final Round Begins

The ballroom is massive and completely packed.

Hundreds of people fill the seats—teams from across the country, coaches, parents, debate enthusiasts. The energy is electric, anticipatory, like everyone knows they're about to witness something significant.

Two podiums face each other about twenty feet apart. Tournament officials set up timing equipment and test microphones. The judges' table sits between the podiums—three college debate coaches and two circuit veterans who will decide which of us wins.

My hands shake slightly as I walk toward my podium. Wellington's team sits in the front rows, Riley giving me a thumbs up, Coach Brennan nodding with calm confidence. Oakridge's team sits opposite, their school colors visible.

And then I see David.

He's already at his podium, arranging materials with methodical precision. Dark suit, blue tie, every inch the composed champion. But I know better now. I know what's underneath—someone terrified of disappointing his family, who stayed up until 2 AM talking about fear and validation.

Our eyes meet across the twenty feet. For just a moment, everything else fades. It's just us, and I can see he's thinking the same thing I am.

This is it. This is what we've been working toward. And it's infinitely more complicated than we imagined.

The tournament director steps up to the microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the National High School Debate Championship final round. Today's competitors are Jordan Hayes of Wellington Hall and David Sterling of Oakridge Prep. Both debaters represent the highest level of high school debate in the country."

The applause is thunderous. I force myself to smile, to look confident and capable.

"Today's resolution," the director continues, and everyone in the room goes quiet, "is: Resolved, that economic sanctions are an effective tool of foreign policy." He pauses. "Jordan Hayes will argue the affirmative position. David Sterling will argue the negative."

I feel a surge of relief. I'm strong on this topic—I've researched sanction effectiveness extensively. But David is equally strong, and negative position gives him rebuttal advantage. It's a fair match.

The director explains the round structure: opening statements, cross-examination periods, constructive speeches, rebuttals. Standard parliamentary format.

"Debaters, are you ready?"

I nod. David does the same.

"Ms. Hayes, you may begin."

I take a deep breath, stepping up to my microphone. The ballroom goes completely silent. Hundreds of eyes are on me, but I focus on the judges' table. This is what I do. This is what I'm good at.

"Thank you." My voice comes out clear and steady. "Economic sanctions represent one of the most important tools available to democratic nations in shaping international relations without resorting to military force. Today I will demonstrate that when properly implemented and strategically targeted, economic sanctions achieve concrete foreign policy objectives while minimizing humanitarian costs."

I launch into my case structure: sanctions isolate rogue regimes, targeted sanctions minimize civilian harm while maximizing pressure on decision-makers, and the historical record demonstrates measurable effectiveness from South African apartheid to Iranian nuclear limitations.

The arguments flow naturally. I'm in my element, building my case with precision, citing evidence. The audience leans forward, engaged. The judges take rapid notes.

When I finish at exactly six minutes fifty seconds, there's a beat of silence before applause fills the ballroom. I step back, heart pounding, and catch Riley's eye. She's grinning.

"Mr. Sterling, your opening statement."

David steps up to his microphone, and the room goes quiet again. He pauses for just a moment, making eye contact with the judges, and then begins.

"Economic sanctions, while superficially appealing as a non-military foreign policy tool, demonstrate consistent failure to achieve stated objectives while creating devastating humanitarian consequences. Today I will show that sanctions are an ineffective middle ground that provides political cover for inaction while causing measurable harm to civilian populations."

His voice is measured, authoritative, confident. He lays out his contentions: sanctions rarely achieve regime change, "targeted" sanctions inevitably harm civilian populations, and the historical record shows sanctions strengthen authoritarian regimes by providing external scapegoats for internal failures.

It's a strong opening. He's hitting all the key arguments I expected, but with nuances I'll have to address carefully.

When David finishes, the applause is equally enthusiastic. He steps back, and for just a second, our eyes meet. There's acknowledgment in his expression. We're both here. We're both bringing our best.

The tournament director announces the cross-examination period. "Ms. Hayes, you may question Mr. Sterling."

I step back up. Cross-examination is where debates get aggressive—opponents trying to trap each other into contradictions. But as I look at David, I remember Coach Brennan's words: recognizing your opponent's humanity shows maturity.

"Mr. Sterling, you argued sanctions rarely achieve regime change. But isn't the goal often behavior modification rather than full regime change?"

"That's a fair distinction. However, even narrowing to behavior modification, the success rate remains poor. Libya is cited as a success story, but scholarship shows multiple factors beyond sanctions contributed to Qaddafi's WMD decision."

"But doesn't that suggest sanctions can be part of an effective multi-tool approach?"

"It suggests sanctions might play a minor role. But that's insufficient justification for the humanitarian costs they impose."

We go back and forth, questions and answers flowing naturally. I'm exposing weaknesses in his framework, he's defending while acknowledging valid points. It's not hostile. It's intellectual. Respectful. Two people genuinely engaging with complex ideas.

Then it's David's turn to cross-examine me.

"Ms. Hayes, you argued that targeted sanctions minimize civilian harm. But can you explain how sanctions that restrict medical supply imports or food security don't inherently harm civilian populations regardless of targeting?"

It's a strong question, hitting directly at one of the tensions in my case. "Targeted sanctions specifically exemptions humanitarian goods including medical supplies and food aid. The harm comes when authoritarian regimes manipulate sanction impacts for propaganda purposes, not from the sanctions themselves."

"But doesn't that concede that sanctions provide authoritarian regimes with political tools while failing to constrain their actual decision-making power?"

He's good. Really good. I have to think fast. "It demonstrates that sanctions must be coupled with strategic communication and humanitarian monitoring. The tool itself remains effective when properly implemented."

The cross-examination continues, both of us probing for weaknesses, both defending our positions. But something unusual is happening. Usually, cross-examination feels like combat—opponents trying to score points, trap each other, expose flaws with aggressive questioning. This feels different.

We're challenging each other intellectually without hostility. When David makes a strong point, I acknowledge it before explaining why my framework still holds. When I expose a potential weakness in his argument, he addresses it directly rather than deflecting.

The judges are leaning forward, clearly engaged. Even the audience seems to sense that something different is happening here—this isn't just two debaters trying to win. This is two people operating at peak intellectual performance, pushing each other toward excellence.

The round continues through constructive speeches. I build on my opening case, introducing additional evidence about sanction effectiveness in pressuring Myanmar's military junta and compelling negotiations with North Korea. David counters with data about Venezuelan sanctions exacerbating humanitarian crises and Iraqi sanctions in the 1990s causing measurable child mortality increases.

We're both bringing everything we have. Every piece of research, every strategic framework, every rhetorical technique we've developed over years of competition. The debate is intense and sophisticated, operating at a level that makes me understand why we're both here in finals.

But what makes this round different from any debate I've had with David before—different from any debate I've had with anyone—is the underlying current of respect.

When David makes a particularly strong point about sanction enforcement challenges, I find myself genuinely impressed by his analysis. When I deliver a rebuttal that clearly lands well with the judges, I catch a fleeting expression on David's face that looks almost like pride.

We're not trying to destroy each other. We're trying to compete at our absolute best, and somehow that means bringing out the best in our opponent too.

The rebuttal phase begins. This is where debates are won or lost—the final chance to dismantle your opponent's case while defending your own. I have five minutes to make my final arguments before David gets the last word with his rebuttal.

I step up to the microphone, my notes in front of me, but I'm not just reading prepared responses anymore. I'm thinking, analyzing, responding to what actually happened in this debate rather than what I anticipated would happen.

"Throughout this round, my opponent has raised legitimate concerns about sanction implementation challenges. But these challenges don't invalidate the fundamental effectiveness of sanctions as a foreign policy tool. They highlight the need for strategic deployment and humanitarian safeguards."

I systematically address his main contentions, using his own evidence to show how targeted approaches address the concerns he raised. I rebuild my case structure, demonstrating how the affirmative position stands even accounting for his strongest objections.

When I finish my rebuttal, I step back from the microphone feeling simultaneously exhausted and exhilarated. I gave everything I had. Whether it was enough remains to be seen.

"Mr. Sterling, your final rebuttal."

David takes his position at the microphone one last time. He has the advantage of speaking last, of being able to respond to everything I said without me having a chance to counter. But I trust that he'll use that advantage fairly, that he'll engage with my arguments rather than just try to overpower them.

And he does.

His final rebuttal is masterful—acknowledging the strengths of my position while systematically explaining why the negative framework better accounts for real-world complexities. He's not dismissing my arguments. He's showing why, even granting their validity, his case is more compelling.

When he finishes, the ballroom erupts in applause. Not polite tournament applause—genuine, enthusiastic recognition of what we both just did.

The tournament director steps back to the microphone. "Thank you to both debaters for an exceptional round. Judges, you may now deliberate. We'll take a brief recess."

David and I both remain at our podiums, breathing hard, processing what just happened. The audience starts talking among themselves, teams discussing the arguments they heard. But I'm looking at David across the twenty feet separating us.

He's looking back at me.

And in that moment, I realize something that should terrify me but somehow doesn't: regardless of who the judges pick as winner, that debate was the best round of my entire life.

Because I didn't face a faceless opponent or an abstract obstacle to overcome. I faced David Sterling—someone who challenged me intellectually, matched me strategically, and pushed me to perform at a level I didn't know I could reach.

Win or lose, we just gave each other exactly what we both needed.
