# Chapter 2: The Sterling Legacy

My dorm room is barely big enough for the furniture Wellington provides—twin bed, desk, narrow closet, bookshelf—but I've made it work. The desk is covered with debate materials: printed research articles, highlighted case briefs, tournament schedules, and my laptop perpetually open to debate forums and video archives. Riley jokes that my side of the room looks like a debate bunker. She's not wrong.

I'd grabbed dinner in the dining hall—quickly, efficiently, sitting alone so I could review notes while I ate—and now I'm back at my desk, diving into the research I should have done weeks ago. If I'm going to beat David Sterling at nationals, I need to understand everything about how Oakridge Prep's debate program operates.

The Oakridge Prep website is everything Wellington's isn't: sleek, professional, probably designed by some alumni who works in tech. Their debate program has its own dedicated page with an archive of tournament results, team photos, and a section called "Legacy of Excellence" that makes my jaw clench.

The Sterling name appears over and over.

I click through to the historical archive and find photos dating back to the 1980s. Richard Sterling—David's father—posed with the nationals trophy in 1987, looking young and confident in a blazer that's probably worth more than my entire debate wardrobe. The caption notes he went on to Yale and then Harvard Law.

Of course he did.

I scroll further. Michael Sterling, one of David's older brothers, won nationals in 2016. Another photo, another trophy, another Sterling looking like winning was inevitable. The next year, James Sterling—the other brother—took the title again.

Three years ago, David Sterling joined Oakridge's debate team as a freshman. The photos show him standing slightly behind the older team members, not quite comfortable yet, but already wearing that composed expression I've come to recognize. By sophomore year, he was competing in varsity rounds. Junior year, he became captain.

I pull up the tournament results from the past two years and start building a spreadsheet. It's something I do for all our major competitors, but I've been tracking David's record with particular attention.

His win rate is eighty-seven percent.

Mine is eighty-three.

Four percentage points. That's what stands between me and being the best debater in New England. Four percentage points and the fact that in head-to-head competitions, David Sterling has beaten me more often than I've beaten him.

I pull up video from our first encounter two years ago—a preliminary round at a regional tournament in Massachusetts. I was a sophomore, new to varsity debate, still figuring out my style. David was a junior, already seasoned, already carrying the Sterling reputation.

I watch myself stumble through a rebuttal that seemed strong at the time but now looks obviously flawed. David dismantled my argument in about ninety seconds. The round wasn't even close.

The second video is from later that same year. I'd improved by then, gotten sharper and faster. But David had adapted too. He won, but the margin was smaller.

By junior year—my third encounter with David Sterling—I'd finally figured out how to match his technical precision with my own aggressive style. I won that round. I remember the surge of triumph, the satisfaction of watching his composed expression crack just slightly when the judges announced Wellington's victory.

He beat me in the next three tournaments.

I close the laptop harder than necessary and lean back in my chair, staring at the ceiling. The problem isn't that David Sterling is a better debater than me. The problem is that he makes it look effortless. Like debate is something he does well simply because he's a Sterling, because excellence is encoded in his DNA along with that perfectly styled dark hair and those sharp cheekbones and—

I stop that train of thought immediately.

This isn't about what David Sterling looks like. This is about strategy. About figuring out his weaknesses and exploiting them the way he's been exploiting mine.

Except I haven't found his weaknesses yet. That's the infuriating part.

A knock on my door interrupts my spiraling thoughts. I know it's Riley before I even open it—she has a specific rhythm to her knock, like she's announcing her presence rather than asking permission.

"Please tell me you're not still working," Riley says as she pushes past me into the room, carrying two mugs of tea from the common room kitchen. She hands me one and settles onto my bed, tucking her legs underneath her. She's changed out of her blazer into Wellington sweatpants and a oversized hoodie, her dark hair pulled into a messy bun.

"I'm researching," I correct, taking the tea. It's chamomile, which means Riley is in mother-hen mode, trying to get me to relax.

"You're obsessing."

"There's a difference."

"Not really." Riley nods toward my laptop. "Let me guess. You're watching Sterling footage again."

I don't answer, which is answer enough.

Riley sighs. "Jordan. You know you're an incredible debater, right? You don't need to prove anything to anyone."

"That's easy to say when you're not a scholarship student."

"That's not what I meant."

"I know." I sit down at my desk chair, cradling the tea. "But it's still true. You've never had someone look at you and wonder if you only got into Wellington because of financial aid quotas. You've never had a teacher assume you need extra help because surely you can't keep up with the legacy students. I have to prove I belong here. Every single day."

Riley's quiet for a moment. She's heard this before, but she listens like it's the first time.

"And beating David Sterling proves that?" she finally asks.

"Beating David Sterling at nationals proves that scholarship students are just as good—better—than legacy kids who've had every advantage handed to them."

"You know David's not your enemy, right? He's just another debater."

I look at Riley like she's suggested I join the Oakridge Prep team. "He's captain of our biggest rival school. He's beaten me at regionals. He's standing between me and nationals. How is that not an enemy?"

"Because enemy implies he's actively trying to hurt you. He's just trying to win. Like you are."

"Which makes us enemies."

Riley rolls her eyes. "You're impossible."

"I'm focused."

"You're obsessed." She leans forward, her expression turning serious. "Look, I get it. David Sterling represents everything about elite prep schools that makes you feel like an outsider. But you're projecting a lot onto someone you've barely had a real conversation with."

"I don't need to have a conversation with him. I've debated him six times. That tells me everything I need to know."

"Does it?" Riley challenges. "You've debated him six times in structured rounds with judges and time limits. Have you ever actually talked to him? Like, as people?"

I think about the handful of interactions David Sterling and I have had outside of rounds. Brief, awkward moments at tournaments—passing each other in hallways, standing near each other during award ceremonies, that one time we both reached for the same coffee carafe at a hospitality table and I yanked my hand back like I'd been burned.

"No," I admit. "And I don't need to. This isn't about being friends. It's about winning."

Riley shakes her head, but she's smiling slightly. "You know what I think?"

"I'm sure you're going to tell me."

"I think you're so focused on David Sterling because he's the only person who challenges you. You've spent two years obsessing over him because he's the only opponent who makes you work for it."

"That's ridiculous."

"Is it? Think about it. Every other team in New England, you know you can beat. But David Sterling is the one person who's as good as you are. Maybe better—"

"He's not better."

"Maybe as good," Riley amends. "And that drives you crazy because you hate not being the best at something you care about."

I want to argue, but the words stick in my throat. Because Riley isn't entirely wrong. David Sterling does make me work harder than any other opponent. He does push me to be sharper, faster, more precise. Every time I debate him, I have to bring my absolute best, and even then, it's a coin flip whether I'll win.

And yes, that drives me crazy.

"Fine," I concede. "Maybe you have a point. But that doesn't change the fact that I need to beat him at nationals. This is my senior year. My last chance."

"Our last chance," Riley corrects gently. "This is the team's goal, not just yours."

The reminder lands with a small sting of guilt. Riley's right—I've been so focused on my personal rivalry with David Sterling that I've sometimes forgotten nationals isn't just about me. It's about Wellington Hall. About our entire team proving we deserve to be on that stage.

"You're right," I say. "I'll try to remember this is bigger than my personal vendetta."

"Personal vendetta," Riley repeats, laughing. "You really do sound obsessed."

"Focused," I insist, but I'm smiling now too.

Riley finishes her tea and stands, stretching. "Okay, I'm going to let you get back to your definitely-not-obsessive research. But Jordan? Maybe consider that when we get to nationals, you might actually benefit from treating David Sterling like a fellow competitor instead of your arch-nemesis."

"Where's the fun in that?"

"Sleep," Riley orders as she heads for the door. "Actual sleep. Not falling asleep at your desk while watching debate footage."

"That was one time."

"It was three times."

When she's gone, I turn back to my laptop. The Oakridge Prep website is still open, David Sterling's junior year team photo staring at me from the screen. He looks confident, composed, untouchable.

But Riley's words stick with me. *The only person who challenges you. Maybe as good as you are.*

I close the laptop and look at the debate materials scattered across my desk. Tournament schedules, research files, strategic notes. Everything organized and planned with precision because that's how I operate. That's how I've survived at Wellington—by being meticulous, by working harder than everyone else, by never giving anyone a reason to doubt I belong.

David Sterling works the same way. I've seen it in his debate style, in the way he prepares, in the precision of his arguments. We're more alike than I want to admit.

Which makes beating him at nationals even more important.

I pick up my phone and set a reminder: six weeks until nationals. Forty-two days to prepare. Forty-two days to get better, sharper, faster than David Sterling.

Forty-two days to prove I'm the best.
