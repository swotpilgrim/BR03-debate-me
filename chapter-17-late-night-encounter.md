# Chapter 17: Late Night Encounter

Sleep is impossible.

I lie in bed staring at the ceiling, listening to Riley's steady breathing and Amanda's soft snoring. The clock reads 12:47 AM. Finals are in less than fourteen hours, and my brain won't stop racing.

I should be preparing mentally. Instead, I keep replaying the hallway moment when David's eyes met mine. The way neither of us looked away. The way my heart hammered with something that felt nothing like competitive adrenaline.

At 1:15, I give up on sleep. I slip out of bed quietly, pull on sweatpants and my Wellington hoodie, and grab my room key. Maybe reviewing notes in the lobby will help.

The hotel hallways are deserted and dimly lit. I take the elevator to the lobby, which is nearly empty. A few exhausted coaches sit in corners with laptops. The front desk clerk barely glances up as I pass.

I find a quiet corner with armchairs and a small table. I pull out my debate materials and spread them across the table.

But even with everything laid out in front of me, I can't concentrate. The words blur together. My mind keeps drifting to tomorrow's finals, to standing across from David Sterling, to the impossible task of competing against someone who's become something more than just an opponent.

Twenty minutes pass. I'm reading the same page of notes for the third time when I hear the elevator chime. Footsteps cross the lobby, and then a familiar voice says, "Can't sleep either?"

I look up to find David Sterling standing nearby, wearing Oakridge sweatpants and a dark hoodie, his hair mussed. He's carrying his own debate materials, and there's something vulnerable about seeing him like this—not the polished prep school captain but just a tired, anxious seventeen-year-old.

"I thought reviewing notes might help," I say. "It's not working."

"Mind if I..." He gestures to the chair across from mine.

I should say no. We're competitors tomorrow. Instead, I nod. "Sure."

David settles into the chair, setting his debate case beside mine. We sit in silence, both pretending to look at our materials.

"The judging panel tomorrow is strong," David finally says. "Three college debate coaches and two circuit veterans."

"I know. I looked them up." I flip through my notes without really seeing them. "They'll be looking for technical precision but also rhetorical impact. No room for sloppy arguments."

"Your rebuttals are never sloppy." He's looking at his laptop screen. Just a statement of fact.

"Neither are yours." I pause. "That cross-examination technique you used in semifinals was effective."

"Thanks. I've been working on making my approach less aggressive. Judges respond better to strategic probing than hostile interrogation."

We fall into discussing debate strategy—topic areas, judging preferences, argumentation frameworks. Comfortable territory. But gradually, the conversation shifts.

"Do you ever get tired of it?" David asks suddenly. "The constant preparation, the pressure to perform, the feeling that every round matters?"

I look up from my notes, surprised by the question. "Sometimes. But debate is what I'm good at. It's what got me into Wellington, what keeps me there."

"Scholarship student?"

"Yeah. My parents are teachers. They couldn't afford Wellington, but I won a full scholarship." I'm not sure why I'm telling him this. Maybe it's the middle of the night and I'm too tired for defenses. "I spent freshman year terrified someone would realize they'd made a mistake admitting me."

David is quiet, then his voice softens. "I spent freshman year terrified I'd be the Sterling who broke the family winning streak. My grandfather won nationals. My father. Both my brothers. There's a plaque in Oakridge's debate room with all their names."

"That's a lot of pressure."

"It's suffocating." He runs his hand through his hair. "Every debate isn't just about me. It's about maintaining a legacy established before I was born. If I lose, I'm not just Jordan Hayes's opponent who came in second. I'm the Sterling who failed."

I've never heard David talk like this—open, vulnerable, admitting fear. It's disarming. "You're not going to lose," I say automatically, then stop. "Wait. I didn't mean—"

"I know what you meant." He looks at me directly now, and there's something unguarded in his expression. "You meant I'm good enough that losing shouldn't be a realistic fear. But that's not how it works in my family. Second place is still failing."

"That's not fair to you."

"No, it's not. But it's reality." He closes his laptop. "I've been trying to live up to the Sterling name for four years. Every coach reminds me of my father's record. Every second place, Professor Caldwell mentions how my brothers never lost. It's like I'm not David Sterling the person—I'm David Sterling, heir to a debate dynasty."

The bitterness in his voice catches me off guard. I've spent two years assuming he was exactly what he appeared—confident, privileged, the golden boy who had everything handed to him. It never occurred to me he might be drowning under expectations.

"I get it," I say quietly. "Different reasons, but I understand that pressure. Every debate I win, I'm proving I deserved the scholarship. Every debate I lose, I'm confirming what part of me has always suspected—that I don't really belong at Wellington, that I'm just a charity case who got lucky."

"You know that's not true."

"Logically, yes. But anxiety doesn't care about logic." I lean back. "Debate became my proof. If I could beat everyone including legacy students with private tutors, then I could prove I belonged. That's why I can't lose. Losing means—"

"Losing means you're human," David interrupts gently. "It means you faced a strong opponent. It doesn't mean anything about your worth."

"Do you actually believe that? Or is that just something you tell yourself?"

He's quiet for a long moment. "I'm working on believing it. Marcus keeps telling me my value isn't determined by debate results. That the legacy is just history, not a mandate. But it's hard to internalize when you've spent your life being told you need to live up to the Sterling name."

I think about Riley saying similar things over the years. I never quite believed her either.

"It's strange," I say slowly, "spending two years hating you as my rival, and then discovering that we're basically fighting the same battle."

"Different sides of the same coin." David manages a small smile. "The scholarship student trying to prove she belongs, and the legacy student trying to prove he's more than just his family name. Both of us using debate as validation."

"And tomorrow we face each other for the championship."

"Tomorrow," he echoes, and something shifts in the air between us. The reminder of finals brings reality back into sharp focus. Tomorrow we'll be opponents again. Tomorrow all this vulnerable honesty will have to be set aside so we can compete.

"I don't know how to do this," I admit. "How to debate you tomorrow after—after the road trip, and the conversations, and..." I gesture vaguely between us, unable to articulate what's changed.

"After getting to know each other as actual people instead of just opponents?"

"Yeah."

David leans forward, elbows on his knees, and I catch a hint of his cologne—something subtle and expensive that somehow suits him perfectly. "I've been thinking about that too. Part of me wishes we were still just rivals. It would make tomorrow simpler."

"Simpler, but not better."

"No," he agrees quietly. "Not better."

We sit in silence for a few moments. The lobby clock reads 1:47 AM now. We've been talking for over half an hour, and I'm not any closer to being ready to sleep. If anything, I'm more awake than before, hyperaware of David's presence across from me, of the strange intimacy of this late-night conversation.

"Can I ask you something?" David says.

"Sure."

"Why do you compete with so much passion? Most debaters stay detached. But you debate like every round matters personally."

No one's ever asked me that before. "Because every round does matter personally. Debate isn't just an intellectual exercise. It's proof I can hold my own with people who had every advantage I didn't. When I'm in a round, I'm proving a middle-class scholarship kid can compete with old money legacy students."

"You realize that approach is exhausting, right?"

"Says the person who carries his entire family legacy into every round."

David laughs quietly. "Fair point. We're both exhausting ourselves for validation that probably won't come from debate trophies."

"Probably not," I agree. "But I don't know how else to be."

"Me neither."

The admission hangs between us. Two debate captains who spent years building armor, acknowledging the armor might not be protecting us from anything except genuine connection.

"What happens after nationals?" I ask. "After tomorrow's finals, win or lose—what happens to us?"

David meets my eyes. "I don't know. I'd like to think we could... I don't know, stay in contact? Not go back to just being rivals who only see each other at tournaments?"

"I'd like that too." The words come out softer than intended. "I've spent two years studying you like an opponent. I think I'd like to actually know you as a person."

"You're already getting there." He glances at his watch. "It's past two AM. We should probably attempt sleep."

"Probably." But neither of us moves. There's something about this moment that makes me reluctant to break the spell.

Finally, David stands and packs his materials. I do the same. We walk to the elevators together.

"What floor?" David asks.

"Five. You?"

"Six." He presses both buttons.

The elevator rises slowly. At the fifth floor, I step out. David holds the door, and for a moment we just look at each other.

"Good luck tomorrow," he says. "I mean it."

"You too." I pause. "And David? Thanks for talking."

"Thanks for listening." The elevator doors close. I catch one last glimpse of his face before he's carried up to the sixth floor.

I walk back to my room in a daze and slip back into bed. Riley is still breathing steadily, Amanda still snoring. They have no idea I just spent two hours talking to David Sterling about fear and pressure and validation-seeking.

I should feel guilty for fraternizing with my opponent the night before finals. I should feel like I've somehow weakened my competitive position by being vulnerable with him.

Instead, I feel like I finally understand what I'm really fighting for tomorrow. Not just a trophy or validation or proof of belonging. Something more complicated and more real—a chance to compete at my absolute best against someone who sees me clearly and challenges me completely.

I close my eyes, and this time, sleep comes easier. Tomorrow I'll face David Sterling in the finals. And somehow, impossibly, that feels exactly right.
