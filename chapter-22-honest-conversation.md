# Chapter 22: Honest Conversation

I make it halfway back to my hotel room before I realize I don't want to go there yet.

The Wellington team is probably gathered together, processing results. Riley will want emotional debriefing. Amanda will have a thousand questions. All of that is fine, normal post-tournament behavior.

But I'm not ready yet. I'm still processing something too big to articulate.

I wander through the convention center instead, following corridors away from the main ballroom. Most tournament activity has cleared out. The halls are mostly empty, quiet.

I turn a corner and find a corridor with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking DC. Afternoon sun streams through the glass. Buildings, streets, distant monuments. A good place to think.

"I was hoping I'd find you."

I turn to see David standing at the entrance to the corridor, debate case still in hand, championship trophy tucked under his arm. He's loosened his tie and his hair is disheveled from teammates messing with it during the celebration.

"How did you know where I'd be?"

"I didn't. I just..." He walks toward me. "I couldn't go back to my room yet either. Needed space to think. Saw you heading this direction."

We stand together at the windows, looking out. The silence feels comfortable. Two people who just spent an hour in intense combat, now just existing without needing to perform.

"You should be celebrating," I finally say. "You won nationals. Your family legacy is intact."

"Yeah. I should be celebrating." David sets the trophy down on a nearby bench, tired of carrying it. "So why does it feel so empty?"

"What do you mean?"

He leans against the window frame. "I spent four years working toward this. Every debate building toward winning nationals and proving I was worthy of the Sterling name. And I did it. I won. By the narrowest margin, but I won."

"But?"

"But it doesn't fix anything." His voice is quiet. "I thought winning would prove something. That I'd finally feel like I earned my place. That the pressure would ease. But standing there with that trophy, all I could think was that nothing actually changed. I'm still the same person with the same fears. Next year will be college debate, then law school, then new expectations. It's never going to be enough."

I turn to face him fully. "So what does that mean?"

"It means I've been chasing validation through victories, and I finally caught one, and it turns out validation doesn't work that way." He looks at me. "You were right last night. Losing doesn't mean you're not good enough. But winning doesn't mean you are good enough either. It's just... a result. A data point. Not a measure of worth."

The honesty catches me off guard. This is David Sterling without the polish or facade. Just a seventeen-year-old realizing his goal didn't deliver what he thought it would.

"I get it," I say quietly. "I spent two years thinking that beating you would prove I deserved my scholarship, that I belonged. And I lost. And you know what? I do belong. Not because of a debate result, but because I was good enough to get there."

"When did you figure that out?"

"About twenty minutes ago," I admit, and David laughs.

"So we're both having existential crises."

"Apparently." I lean against the window. "Your rebuttal was devastating. That argument about sanctions creating internal pressure—I barely countered it."

"I noticed because you would have noticed it if our positions were reversed." He smiles slightly. "Two years of rivalry means we've studied each other. We were perfectly matched."

"Almost perfectly matched. You won."

"By fractions of points. That could have gone either way."

I think about that. Two debaters at equal levels, forcing judges to make distinctions so fine they're almost arbitrary. "So you won, but it could have been me."

"It could have been you." He turns to face me. "And honestly? Part of me wishes it had been."

"That's a weird thing to say to the person you just beat."

"I'm in a weird place." He runs his hand through his hair. "I feel like I should be celebrating and all I want to do is talk to you about what just happened."

"We are talking."

"I mean really talk. About what's been happening between us since that first van ride. Because something has been happening, right? I'm not imagining that?"

My heart does something complicated. "No. You're not imagining it."

"What is it though? What is this?"

I don't have an answer. I've been so focused on the debate, on nationals, on competition that I haven't let myself fully examine what's been building between David and me. But standing here in this quiet corridor, with nothing left to compete over and everything laid bare, I can't avoid it anymore.

"I think," I say slowly, "we spent two years seeing each other as opponents. Then the road trip forced us into proximity and we discovered we're actual people. And those people... understand each other."

"Understand each other," David repeats. "That's one way to put it."

"What would you call it?"

He's quiet, looking at me with intensity. "I'd call it realizing that the person I've been obsessed with beating is actually the person who gets me better than anyone else. Who sees my capabilities and respects them. Who pushes me to be better while making me feel like who I am is already enough."

Oh.

"David—"

"I know the timing is terrible," he continues. "We just competed. I just beat you. We're going back to separate schools. But I need to say this."

"Say what?"

He takes a breath. "That somewhere between the van ride and this moment, you stopped being Jordan Hayes, my rival, and became Jordan Hayes, the person I can't stop thinking about. The person I wanted to talk to at two AM. The person whose opinion matters more than the judges' scores. The person I'm standing with instead of celebrating with my team."

My brain is trying to process his words, but my heart is moving faster. "You're saying..."

"I'm saying I have feelings for you. Real feelings that have nothing to do with debate and everything to do with who you actually are." He looks almost desperate now, vulnerable in a way I've never seen. "And I know you might not feel the same way. You might still see me as just your rival, or the person who beat you in finals. But I needed you to know. Because I can't go back to just being opponents after this."

I should be careful. I should think about this logically. We're from different schools, we have complicated history, we just competed in the most intense debate of our lives. This is terrible timing for feelings.

But standing here looking at David Sterling—who spent two years as my rival and one week as something more, who challenged me and saw me and pushed me to be my absolute best—I realize I don't want to be careful.

"You're not just my rival," I say. "You haven't been for a while now. And that terrifies me because I spent two years knowing exactly what you were to me, and now everything's changed and I don't know how to categorize you anymore."

"What if you don't categorize me? What if we just... see what this is?"

"What what is?"

"This thing between us. Whatever we're calling it." David steps closer. "Jordan, I don't have answers. I don't know how we make this work with separate schools and graduation coming and everything else. But I know I don't want the road trip to be the end of whatever this is."

"Me neither." The admission comes out quieter than I intended. "I don't want to go back to just seeing each other at tournaments. I don't want to go back to being rivals who only talk about debate strategy."

"So what do we want?"

I look at him—really look at him. At David Sterling who admitted his family legacy is suffocating. Who stayed up until 2 AM talking about fear and pressure. Who debates with passion and respects his opponents and just admitted he has feelings for me.

"I want to actually know you," I say. "Not as my opponent. As a person. I want to text you about things that have nothing to do with debate. I want to see you outside of tournaments. I want to figure out who we are to each other when we're not competing."

"I want that too." Relief floods his expression. "So we're doing this? Actually trying... whatever this is?"

"I think we are."

"Even though I just beat you in finals?"

I smile. "Especially because you beat me in finals. Because it proved we're equals. Because you respected me enough to compete at your absolute best instead of holding back."

"I would never hold back against you. That would be insulting."

"I know. That's why this works."

We stand there in the quiet corridor, DC cityscape visible through the windows behind us, and something shifts. We're not rivals anymore. We're not just opponents who happened to get to know each other. We're something new, something undefined, something that started with competition but became something else entirely.

"We should probably head back," David says eventually. "Awards ceremony is in a few hours. Our teams are probably wondering where we are."

"Probably." But neither of us moves.

"Jordan?" His voice is softer now.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for being the kind of opponent who made me better. And thank you for being the kind of person I could fall for."

My breath catches. "You're falling for me?"

"I think I've been falling for you since you argued with me about van snacks at that rest stop."

I laugh despite myself. "That's possibly the least romantic thing you could have said."

"I'm a debate nerd. We're not known for romance."

"Noted." I pick up my debate materials. "Come on. Let's get back before Riley sends out a search party."

We walk back through the convention center together, and when we reach the point where we have to split up—Wellington wing one direction, Oakridge wing another—we both pause.

"See you at the ceremony?" David asks.

"Yeah. See you there."

He hesitates, then: "Jordan? Whatever happens next, I'm glad it was you in that finals round."

"Me too. Even though you won."

"Especially because I won. Because it proved we're equals."

I watch him walk away, championship trophy under his arm, and realize that I'm smiling. I lost nationals. But I gained something better.

I gained David Sterling. Not as my rival. As something infinitely more complicated and infinitely more worthwhile.
