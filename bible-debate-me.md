# BIBLE: Debate Me

## Story Premise

Jordan Hayes, captain of Wellington Hall's debate team, has spent two years locked in intellectual warfare with David Sterling, captain of rival Oakridge Prep. Their debates are legendary on the New England circuit—fierce, brilliant, and deeply personal. When budget cuts force both teams to share transportation to nationals in Washington DC, Jordan and David face six hundred miles trapped in a van together. The road trip that was supposed to be torture becomes something else entirely: a chance to discover that their fiercest opponent might actually be their perfect match.

## Protagonist: Jordan Hayes

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Jordan is a senior at Wellington Hall, a competitive prep school in Connecticut. She's a scholarship student from a middle-class family—her parents are teachers who sacrificed to send her to a top school. She's spent her entire Wellington career proving she belongs, fighting against subtle dismissals from legacy students who assume scholarship kids are less capable. Debate became her weapon and her validation.

**Personality:** Jordan is fierce, passionate, and relentlessly determined. She never backs down from an argument and hates conceding any point, even small ones. She's whip-smart with a quick wit, but underneath her combative exterior, she's driven by insecurity about being taken seriously. She sees every debate as a test of whether she deserves to be at Wellington, and she cannot afford to lose. Her friends know she's loyal and funny when she lets her guard down, but in debate mode, she's all armor and sharp edges.

**Goal:** Win nationals. It's her senior year, her last chance to prove she's the best, and she's determined to take down David Sterling on the biggest stage in high school debate.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Jordan fears that if she's not constantly fighting, she'll be dismissed and forgotten—that without her competitive edge, she's nothing.

**Arc:** Jordan learns that being vulnerable and letting someone truly see her doesn't make her weak. She discovers that partnership—having someone who challenges her and respects her capabilities—is more valuable than always fighting alone. By the end, she's still competitive but no longer needs debate victories to validate her worth.

## Love Interest: David Sterling

**Age:** 18

**Background:** David is a senior at Oakridge Prep, a prestigious boarding school with a two-hundred-year history. He's a legacy student—his grandfather, father, and two older brothers all attended Oakridge, and all were debate champions. His family name carries weight and expectations. David has spent his entire academic career trying to live up to the Sterling reputation, and debate is where he's supposed to shine. The pressure to maintain family excellence has made him meticulous and guarded.

**Personality:** David appears confident, composed, and sometimes smug—the perfect prep school golden boy. He's brilliant and strategic, always three moves ahead in any argument. But his perfectionism is armor. He's terrified of being the Sterling who fails, the one who breaks the family winning streak. Underneath the polished exterior, he's thoughtful, self-aware, and desperately lonely in a life defined by expectations rather than genuine connection. He uses intellectual superiority as a shield against getting close to anyone.

**Initial Barrier:** David seems like everything Jordan resents about prep school elites—privileged, entitled, and dismissive. His confidence looks like arrogance, and she assumes he's never had to fight for anything.

**Hidden Depth:** David's perfection is a prison. He's never allowed himself to be vulnerable or uncertain because his family's reputation rides on his success. His rivalry with Jordan is the only relationship where someone truly pushes him, challenges him, and treats him as an equal opponent rather than a Sterling heir who must win.

**Arc:** David learns to separate his worth from his family's expectations and to value genuine connection over maintaining a perfect image. He discovers that losing—or winning by the narrowest margin against someone who makes him better—matters more than an untarnished record. By the end, he's willing to be vulnerable and real with Jordan, even if it means risking the composure he's always maintained.

## Supporting Cast

### Riley Morrison - Wellington Hall Debate Team Member

Riley is Jordan's best friend and vice-captain of Wellington's debate team. She's a junior, brilliant at research and opposition analysis, with a dry sense of humor that keeps Jordan grounded. Riley is the one who first notices that Jordan's obsession with David Sterling seems less like pure rivalry and more like something else. She's protective of Jordan but not afraid to call her out when Jordan's competitive instinct goes too far. Riley is practical, observant, and serves as both confidante and voice of reason throughout the road trip.

### Marcus Webb - Oakridge Prep Debate Team Member

Marcus is David's closest friend and second-in-command on Oakridge's team. He's charismatic, easygoing, and serves as the social bridge between the two teams during the road trip. Marcus has known David since freshman year and sees through his perfect facade—he knows David's family pressure and tries to get him to relax. He's the first to recognize that David's fixation on beating Jordan Hayes has emotional layers David won't admit. Marcus is funny, perceptive, and becomes an unexpected ally in bringing the rival captains together.

### Coach Patricia Brennan - Wellington Hall Debate Coach

Coach Brennan is in her forties, sharp-minded, and fiercely protective of her students. She's been coaching debate for fifteen years and has mentored Jordan since freshman year. She sees Jordan's potential but also recognizes when Jordan's competitiveness becomes self-destructive. On the road trip, she's the adult supervision trying to keep two rival teams from killing each other in a van. She's firm but caring, and she notices the shift between Jordan and David before they fully admit it to themselves.

### Professor Richard Caldwell - Oakridge Prep Debate Coach

Professor Caldwell is a distinguished academic in his fifties who treats debate like Oxford Union tradition. He's formal, precise, and has impossibly high standards—particularly for David, whom he sees as carrying on the Sterling legacy. He's less warm than Coach Brennan but equally dedicated to his students. During the road trip, his interactions with Coach Brennan show that even adult rivals can find common ground. He represents the weight of expectation David is trying to escape.

### Amanda Price - Wellington Hall Junior Debater

Amanda is an enthusiastic junior on Wellington's team, newer to competitive debate but passionate about learning. She idolizes Jordan and watches the rivalry with David with wide-eyed fascination. Her innocence and excitement serve as contrast to the intensity between the captains. She asks uncomfortable questions that force Jordan to examine her feelings, and her genuine joy in debate reminds Jordan why she loved it before it became about proving herself.

### Christopher Hayes - Oakridge Prep Sophomore Debater

Christopher is a sophomore on Oakridge's team, academically gifted but still learning competitive strategy. He looks up to David and tries to emulate his composed debate style. During the road trip, Christopher becomes fascinated by Jordan's passionate approach, which contrasts with Oakridge's more formal tradition. His questions to both captains about their rivalry inadvertently push them to articulate what they actually think of each other.

## Setting: Connecticut to Washington DC

**Time:** Present day, late April/early May (nationals weekend)

**Key Locations:**

- **Wellington Hall (Connecticut):** Jordan's boarding school, competitive and academically rigorous but slightly less prestigious than Oakridge. The debate team practices in a converted library seminar room with worn tables and championship plaques on the walls. The campus has modern brick buildings and a scrappy, prove-yourself energy.

- **Oakridge Prep (Connecticut):** David's boarding school, traditional New England prep with ivy-covered stone buildings and manicured lawns. The debate room is wood-paneled with portraits of past champions—including David's father and brothers. Everything at Oakridge speaks to history, tradition, and excellence.

- **The Van:** A twelve-passenger rental van becomes the main setting for Act 1 and 2. Cramped quarters with duffel bags, debate cases, snacks, and too many teenagers. The forced proximity and lack of escape create the pressure cooker for Jordan and David's evolving dynamic.

- **Hotels En Route:** Standard road trip hotels with breakfast buffets, lobbies with worn furniture, and hallways where late-night conversations happen. These spaces allow for smaller group interactions away from team dynamics.

- **Washington DC Convention Center:** The nationals venue, massive and impersonal, with hundreds of debaters from across the country. Tournament rounds happen in hotel conference rooms and convention halls. The scale represents the stakes—this is the biggest stage in high school debate.

**Period Details:** Contemporary boarding school setting with timeless prep school traditions. Debate tournaments follow classic parliamentary or Lincoln-Douglas format. Communication happens face-to-face, through notes, and via basic cell phones (texting but not smartphones dominating life). The focus is on direct interaction during the road trip, where trapped proximity forces genuine conversation. Schools maintain formal dress codes for tournaments: blazers, ties, skirts or dress pants.

**Atmosphere:** Intellectual intensity mixed with teenage emotion and boarding school social dynamics. The debate world has its own hierarchy, rituals, and pressures. The road trip creates intimacy through proximity—long hours in the van, shared meals at rest stops, hotel rooms across the hall, late-night strategy sessions that turn personal. Washington DC during nationals is controlled chaos: hundreds of driven students, exhausted coaches, and the electric tension of championship competition.

## Tone & Voice

First-person POV from Jordan's perspective. Her narrative voice is sharp, quick-witted, and intellectually engaged—she thinks in arguments and counterarguments even outside debate rounds. The tone balances sophistication with authentic teenage emotion: Jordan is brilliant but also seventeen, struggling with feelings she doesn't want to admit. Her internal monologue is honest about her insecurities beneath the competitive armor. The voice captures both the intensity of academic competition and the vulnerability of first love. Humor comes through Jordan's observations about road trip absurdity and her reluctant awareness that David Sterling is more complicated than she wants him to be. The debate scenes have technical sophistication but remain emotionally grounded in what winning or losing means to these characters.

## Theme

The theme explores the difference between competition and connection, and how the person who challenges us most might be exactly who we need. Jordan's journey is about learning that vulnerability isn't weakness and that letting someone see your authentic self—not just your armor—creates deeper strength. The story examines how fighting to prove yourself can become exhausting isolation, while finding someone who sees your capability and respects it fully creates genuine partnership. It's about the moment you realize that someone who pushes you to be better, who matches your intensity, who refuses to let you hide behind your defenses, is worth more than winning.

## Romance Trope(s)

Primary tropes are rivals-to-lovers and forced proximity. Jordan and David have two years of competitive history as opposing debate captains—their rivalry is legendary and personal. The forced road trip creates sustained proximity where they cannot escape each other, breaking down the antagonistic dynamic through accumulated small moments. Academic competition provides both the initial barrier and the ultimate test of their relationship when they face each other in finals. The romance follows the classic pattern where intellectual equals discover that their obsession with each other was masking attraction all along.
