# Chapter 4: Budget Crisis

The email from Coach Brennan arrives during lunch on a Tuesday, two weeks before we're supposed to leave for nationals.

*Jordan—Please come to my office after your last class today. Important matter regarding nationals travel. —Coach B*

I read it three times, trying to parse the tone. Coach Brennan isn't usually cryptic. The vague *important matter* makes my stomach clench with apprehension.

"That doesn't sound good," Riley says, reading over my shoulder.

"It's probably just logistics," I say, but I don't believe it, and from Riley's expression, she doesn't either.

I spend the rest of the day distracted, barely paying attention in English and completely zoning out during chemistry lab until my partner nudges me to remind me we're recording temperature readings.

By the time my last class ends and I'm walking across campus toward the administrative building, I've constructed about fifteen different scenarios for this meeting. None of them are good.

Coach Brennan's office is small and organized in the way that suggests too much paperwork and not enough storage. Filing cabinets line one wall, tournament schedules cover a bulletin board, and her desk is buried under stacks of folders and budget spreadsheets.

She looks up when I knock on her open door, and the expression on her face confirms my worst fears.

"Jordan. Come in. Close the door."

I do, and sit in the chair across from her desk. My hands are gripping my backpack straps so tightly my knuckles are white.

Coach Brennan doesn't waste time with small talk. "I had a meeting with Headmaster Chen and the finance committee this morning. We have a problem."

My throat is suddenly dry. "What kind of problem?"

"Budget cuts." She gestures to the spreadsheets on her desk. "The school's endowment took unexpected losses this quarter, and discretionary spending across all departments is being reduced by thirty percent. Athletic programs, arts programs, and academic activities—including debate."

"Okay," I say slowly. "So we have less funding for nationals. That's—we can work with that. We can fundraise, or—"

"Jordan." Coach Brennan's voice is gentle but firm. "The cuts are severe. The school can't fund the nationals trip at all."

The words don't make sense at first. I hear them, but they don't connect to anything real.

"Can't fund it," I repeat. "You mean, like, they're cutting some of the budget. We'd have to—"

"I mean the school can't fund the trip," Coach Brennan says. "No van rental, no gas money, no hotel rooms, no meal stipend. The estimated cost for taking six students and one coach to Washington, DC for three days is approximately forty-five hundred dollars. As of this morning, the debate program has a travel budget of zero dollars."

The room feels like it's tilting. I grip the edge of her desk to steady myself.

"But we qualified," I say, and I hate how my voice sounds—small and desperate. "We spent the entire year working toward nationals. We earned our spot."

"I know." Coach Brennan looks genuinely pained. "I've been arguing with administration all day. I pointed out everything you just said. But the finance committee's decision is final. There's no money for nationals travel."

"Then we fundraise," I say, sitting up straighter, trying to regain control. "We have two weeks. We can organize events, reach out to parents for donations, contact alumni—"

"I've already started making calls," Coach Brennan interrupts. "I spent my lunch break contacting every debate alumni I could think of. The response has been... limited. Most alumni contribute to the general endowment fund, and they've already donated for the year. Asking for additional emergency funds this late is unlikely to work."

"But we have to try," I insist. "We can't just give up. What if we cut the team size? Take fewer students, reduce hotel costs—"

"Even if we cut the team to three students and stayed in the cheapest possible accommodations, we're still looking at over two thousand dollars. And we'd have to leave students who qualified behind, which doesn't seem fair."

"What about partial funding? If parents could contribute—"

"Jordan." Coach Brennan's tone makes me stop. "I've run every scenario. I've looked at every option. Unless we can raise forty-five hundred dollars in less than two weeks—which is realistically not possible—we can't afford to send the team to nationals."

The weight of it crashes over me all at once. We're not going to nationals. After a year of preparation, after qualifying, after building strategies and practicing six days a week and visualizing myself standing on that stage in Washington, DC—we're not going.

I'm not going to compete. I'm not going to prove myself on the national stage. I'm not going to face David Sterling in the round that matters most.

"There has to be something," I say, and I hear the desperation in my voice but I can't stop it. "Some solution we haven't thought of. Some fund or grant or—"

"I'm still looking," Coach Brennan says. "I'm not giving up. But I need you to understand how serious this is. Right now, with two weeks until departure, we don't have a way to get to nationals."

I stand up abruptly, unable to sit still. "This isn't fair. We did everything right. We worked harder than any other team in New England. We earned this."

"I know."

"No, you don't know," I snap, and immediately regret it, but the words keep coming. "This was supposed to be my year. My chance to prove that Wellington belongs at nationals, that I belong there. And now it's being taken away because of budget problems that have nothing to do with us?"

Coach Brennan doesn't reprimand me for the outburst. She just waits until I run out of words, breathing hard, feeling tears threatening but refusing to let them fall.

"I'm going to keep fighting for this," Coach Brennan says quietly. "I'm going to make more calls, explore every possible option. But I need you to prepare the team for the possibility that we might not be able to attend."

"You want me to tell them?"

"You're captain. They'll hear it better from you than from me."

The unfairness of that lands like another blow. I have to be the one to destroy my team's dreams because the school's endowment had a bad quarter.

"When?" I ask.

"Soon. I don't want them hearing rumors. If we're going to find a solution, we need to be realistic about our options and timeframe."

I nod numbly and leave her office, walking through the administrative building in a daze. Outside, the campus looks exactly the same as it did an hour ago—students walking to dorms or the library, groups studying on the quad lawn, spring afternoon sunlight making everything look peaceful and normal.

But nothing is normal. Nothing is okay.

I text the team group chat: *Emergency meeting. Practice room. 4:30.*

Riley responds immediately: *What happened?*

I don't answer. I can't explain this in a text message.

By the time I reach the practice room, I've composed myself enough to seem calm, but inside I'm screaming. The team files in—Riley looking worried, Amanda nervous, Marcus and Liam confused but picking up on the tension.

"Okay," Amanda says once everyone's settled. "What's going on? Your text sounded serious."

"It is." I stand at the front of the room, hands braced on the back of a chair because I don't trust myself to stand without support. "I just met with Coach Brennan. There's been a budget crisis at the school. Endowment losses, spending cuts across all programs."

I watch their faces, seeing the moment they understand where this is going.

"The debate program's travel budget has been eliminated," I continue. "As of right now, we don't have funding to go to nationals."

The silence is absolute.

Then everyone starts talking at once.

"What do you mean no funding?"

"Can't we fundraise?"

"My parents could contribute—"

"How much do we need?"

I hold up my hand. "Coach Brennan estimates we need forty-five hundred dollars to cover van rental, gas, hotels, meals, and registration fees. We have two weeks."

"That's impossible," Liam says flatly.

"It's not impossible," Riley counters. "Difficult, but not impossible. If we organize—"

"What kind of fundraising could possibly bring in forty-five hundred dollars in two weeks?" Marcus asks. "Bake sales? Car washes? We'd need to sell, like, a thousand cupcakes."

"So we sell a thousand cupcakes," Amanda says desperately. "Or we do multiple events. Multiple revenue streams. We can figure this out."

We spend the next hour brainstorming. Every idea gets thrown on the whiteboard: fundraising events, parent contributions, alumni donations, corporate sponsorships. Riley takes notes, organizing ideas by feasibility and potential return.

But as we talk through each option, the reality becomes clearer. Fundraising events take time to organize. Parent contributions won't cover the full cost. Alumni have already donated. Corporate sponsorships require approval processes that take weeks.

By the time we've exhausted our ideas, the energy has shifted from desperate optimism to defeated acceptance.

"Maybe Coach Brennan will figure something out," Amanda says weakly. "She said she's still looking for solutions."

"Maybe," I say, but I don't believe it.

The meeting breaks up with promises to keep brainstorming, to talk to parents, to not give up hope. But I can see it in everyone's faces. We're not going to nationals.

After everyone leaves, I stay in the empty practice room. The late afternoon sunlight slants through the windows, casting long shadows across the worn tables. The championship plaques on the wall catch the light—decades of Wellington Hall debate achievements.

None of it matters if we can't afford to compete.

I sink into a chair and stare at the whiteboard covered with our desperate fundraising ideas. Two weeks ago, I was visualizing myself at nationals, preparing to face David Sterling, ready to prove I was the best.

Now I might not get there at all.

The worst part is that this is out of my control. I can't debate my way out of a budget crisis. I can't win an argument against a finance committee. All the preparation and hard work in the world doesn't matter when the obstacle is money.

For the first time since I started debate, I feel powerless.

I pull out my phone and stare at the nationals preparation schedule I've been meticulously maintaining. Six weeks of planning, potentially worthless.

I should delete it. Start preparing for the disappointment. Accept that this year won't end the way I planned.

But I can't make myself do it. Not yet.

Instead, I sit in the empty practice room as the sunlight fades, surrounded by the evidence of Wellington Hall's debate legacy, and try to imagine a scenario where this still works out.

I come up empty.
