# Chapter 29: Moving Forward

The van pulls into Wellington's parking lot just after noon. The familiar campus stretches out before us—red brick buildings, manicured lawns, spring flowers blooming. After a week on the road, it looks surreal.

Coach Brennan puts the van in park. "All right, teams. Unload your gear. Wellington students, you're home. Oakridge, we'll drop you at your campus in thirty minutes."

Everyone climbs out, stretching road-tired muscles. The parking lot is quiet—most students in class. Just us, two debate teams returning from nationals, changed in ways that have nothing to do with tournament results.

David and I help unload the van. Duffel bags, debate cases, the championship trophy. Everything gets sorted into Wellington and Oakridge piles.

Riley grabs her bag and pulls me aside. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just weird being back."

"Are you going to say goodbye to him properly, or avoid emotional vulnerability?"

"I don't do that."

"You absolutely do. But right now—go talk to David before Oakridge leaves. Don't let this trip end without figuring out what happens next."

She's right.

I walk over to where David's loading the last Oakridge bags into the van. Marcus sees me approaching and immediately makes himself scarce, muttering something about checking on the sophomores.

"Hey," I say.

David turns, and his expression shifts to something warm. "Hey."

"So. You're leaving in thirty minutes."

"Yeah."

"And then what?"

"What do you mean?"

I gesture between us. "This. What are we doing? Are we texting? Are we seeing each other? Are we pretending last night didn't happen and going back to being rivals?"

David steps closer, glancing around to make sure no one's paying attention. "Can we talk? Somewhere not in a parking lot?"

"Yeah. Okay."

We walk across campus together. It's strange being here with David Sterling—my rival for two years, now someone I held hands with in the back of a van. A few students notice us together and do double-takes, but no one stops us.

We end up at a bench overlooking the athletic fields. The track is empty, baseball diamond deserted.

David sits, and I sit beside him. Close enough that our shoulders touch.

"I don't want the road trip to be the end of this," he says. "Whatever this is between us."

"Neither do I." I look at him. "But David, we go to different schools. Graduation is in three weeks. Finals start Monday. We have exactly zero time for a relationship right now."

"Then we make time."

"How?"

"I drive to Wellington on weekends. You come to Oakridge. We study together. We figure out how to exist in each other's lives outside debate tournaments."

It sounds simple when he says it like that. But I know it won't be simple. We're both busy, both focused, both dealing with end-of-year stress and college preparation and a hundred other things that will compete for attention.

"I'm scared this won't work," I admit. "That we'll try and fail and I'll lose you."

"You won't lose me." His hand finds mine on the bench. "Jordan, I spent two years knowing you as my opponent. Getting to know the real you this past week—that's what I want more of. Not less."

"What if we're only good at being rivals? What if without competition between us, there's nothing?"

"Do you really believe that?"

I think about the conversations we've had over the past week. About family pressure and perfectionism and what happens after high school. About being seen and understood.

"No," I say finally. "I don't believe that."

"Good. Because I think we're going to be excellent at this."

"At what exactly?"

"At being together. At challenging and supporting each other. At being partners instead of opponents."

Partners. The word sits between us, weighted with possibility.

"I'm still going to be competitive," I warn him. "I'm still going to push and argue and want to win."

"I know. I don't want you to change that." David shifts to face me more fully. "Jordan, the fact that you challenge me—that's what I like most about you. You don't let me coast. You don't accept mediocrity. You push me to be better. That's not something I want to lose."

"I feel the same way about you. You're the only person who's ever matched me completely. Who doesn't get intimidated or resentful when I'm at my most intense. You just... match it."

"So we keep matching each other. Just in a different context." He squeezes my hand. "What do you think? Are you willing to try this with me?"

I look at David Sterling—his earnest expression, his careful composure cracking, the way he's looking at me like I'm something precious. Two years of rivalry. One week of road trip proximity. Last night in the hotel hallway when everything changed.

"Yes," I say. "I'm willing to try."

His smile is beautiful and relieved. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. Let's figure out what we are to each other when we're not opponents. Let's see if we're as good at partnership as we were at rivalry."

"We will be. I know it."

"How can you be so sure?"

"Because we're both stubborn and determined and used to working for what we want. And I want this." He leans closer. "I want you."

My heart does something complicated in my chest. "I want this too. I want you too."

We sit there for a moment, processing what we just committed to. Not just vague promises, but actual intentional effort to build something together.

"So," David says. "Logistics. Next weekend, I'll drive to Wellington. We'll go to dinner. An actual date."

"Okay."

"And then the weekend after that, you come to Oakridge. We'll find something to do in town. Figure out what we enjoy doing together that isn't debate."

"We might not have anything in common outside debate."

"We have plenty in common. We both love arguing about everything, we both read obsessively, we both have strong opinions about coffee quality."

I laugh. "That's true."

"And if we discover we're incompatible about everything else, at least we'll have figured it out early." His tone makes it clear he doesn't believe that's going to happen.

"What about after graduation? When nationals is over and we're not in high school debate anymore?"

"Both going to Boston for college. You're at BU, I'm at Harvard. That's closer than we are now—twenty-minute subway ride instead of thirty-minute drive."

I'd forgotten that detail. Or maybe I'd been avoiding thinking about it because planning that far ahead felt presumptuous. But he's right—we'll both be in Boston starting in August.

"So this could actually work," I say slowly. "The logistics could actually work."

"They can work if we want them to work. And I want them to work." David stands up, pulling me to my feet with him. "Come on. I have about fifteen minutes before Oakridge leaves. Let's make the most of it."

We walk back toward the parking lot, slower this time, neither quite ready to say goodbye. Around us, campus continues its normal rhythm—students moving between buildings, professors heading to lunch.

Except this isn't any other day. This is the day nationals ends and something else begins.

We reach the parking lot, and the Oakridge team is already loading back into the van. Marcus sees us approaching and waves, then very obviously looks away to give us privacy.

"So," David says. "I'll text you tonight."

"You better."

"And next weekend. Saturday. I'll drive down around noon?"

"Sounds perfect."

He steps closer, and even though we're in a public parking lot with both teams watching, he cups my cheek with one hand. "Jordan Hayes. I'm really glad we were forced to share a van for six hundred miles."

I laugh. "Me too. Even if you did try to control the music selections."

"You have terrible taste in road trip music."

"I have excellent taste. You're just too pretentious to appreciate it."

"See? This is what I mean. You challenge everything I say. It's perfect."

And then he kisses me—right there in Wellington's parking lot, with our teams watching and Coach Brennan shaking his head in amusement.

The kiss is sweet and certain, easier than last night. Like we're already learning each other. Like this is the first of many kisses, not the last.

When we pull apart, I'm smiling. He's smiling.

"I'll see you next weekend," David says.

"See you then."

He climbs into the van. I step back and watch as Professor Caldwell starts the engine. The Oakridge team waves through the windows—Marcus giving an enthusiastic thumbs up, the sophomores grinning, everyone clearly thrilled about their captains' changed relationship.

The van pulls out of the parking lot. David looks back through the rear window, and I wave.

Riley appears at my side as the van disappears down the road. "So. You're dating David Sterling now."

"Apparently."

"How do you feel about it?"

I think about the question. Two weeks ago, if someone had told me I'd be standing here watching David Sterling drive away and feeling like something precious was leaving, I would have laughed.

But now?

"I feel good," I say. "Nervous, but good. Like maybe I found something better than winning."

"Which is?"

"Someone who sees me completely and respects me anyway. Someone who challenges me to be better while making me feel like who I am is already enough."

Riley grins. "That's disgustingly romantic."

"I know."

We head toward the dorms, and I pull out my phone. Already there's a text from David.

David: *Made it approximately one mile before I started missing you. This is going to be a long week.*

I text back: *Good thing we're both used to long-term strategy. We can handle delayed gratification.*

David: *True. Though I'm starting to think competing against you was easier than waiting to see you.*

Me: *Pretty sure that's not true. I made you work very hard for those wins.*

David: *You made me work hard for everything. That's what I like about you.*

I'm smiling as I put my phone away. Riley's watching me with an amused expression.

"Texting him already?"

"Maybe."

"You two are going to be insufferable, aren't you?"

"Probably."

But I don't care. Because after two years of rivalry, one week of forced proximity, and a kiss in a hotel hallway that changed everything, I'm finally figuring out what David Sterling and Jordan Hayes look like when they're not opponents.

And I think we're going to be even better at partnership than we were at rivalry.
