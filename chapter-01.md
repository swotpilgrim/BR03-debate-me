# Chapter 1: The Championship Mindset

"Again," I say, crossing my arms as I lean against the scarred wooden table at the front of Wellington Hall's debate practice room. "And this time, actually listen to the rebuttal before you start formulating your response."

Amanda Price, our enthusiastic but still-green junior, nods and squares her shoulders. Across from her, Riley Morrison—my best friend and vice-captain—takes her position with the patience of someone who's been through my drills a hundred times before.

"Cross-examination begins now," I announce, clicking the timer on my phone.

The familiar rhythm of debate fills the room. Question, answer, deflect, redirect. Riley's good—she always has been—but Amanda's still learning to think three moves ahead instead of just responding to what's directly in front of her. I watch the exchange with the critical eye of someone who's spent the last three years perfecting this craft, analyzing every hesitation, every weak transition, every moment where an opponent could slip through a gap in the argument.

When the timer sounds, I hold up my hand. "Better. Amanda, you're still telegraphing your responses. I could see you forming your answer before Riley even finished her question. In a real round, your opponent will notice that and exploit it."

"Sorry." Amanda pushes her dark hair behind her ear, looking frustrated with herself. "I'm trying to—"

"Don't apologize. Fix it." The words come out sharper than I intended, and I force myself to soften slightly. "Look, you've got good instincts. You just need to trust them faster. Let's run it again."

Riley catches my eye and gives me a look that clearly says *go easy*. I ignore her. We don't have time for easy. Not with nationals six weeks away. Not when Oakridge Prep is probably running drills right now with the kind of laser focus that comes from expecting to win.

The practice room at Wellington Hall isn't much to look at—worn tables arranged in a rough circle, whiteboards covered with argument structures and logical fallacies, championship plaques from decades past lining one wall. Some of those plaques are dusty relics from the 1970s, back when Wellington's debate program was a regional powerhouse. Others are shinier, more recent. Last year's regional championship sits on the top shelf, Wellington Hall etched in clean letters beneath the Northeastern Debate Consortium seal.

It's not enough. Regional champion is good, but it's not nationals. It's not the best. And I didn't spend three years fighting to prove I belong at Wellington Hall just to be satisfied with "good enough."

My phone buzzes on the table. I glance at it and see a reminder notification: *Review Sterling footage*. As if I needed a reminder. As if I haven't been thinking about it all day.

"All right," I say, cutting into the practice round Riley and Amanda have started without my signal. "Let's take ten. Get water, clear your heads, then we're running full rebuttals."

The team scatters—Amanda heading for her water bottle, the two sophomores we brought up from JV this year huddling together to compare notes. Riley, predictably, comes straight to me.

"You know she's not going to learn faster just because you push harder," Riley says quietly, keeping her voice low enough that Amanda won't hear.

"She'll learn faster if she's challenged."

"She'll burn out if you don't ease up."

I turn to face Riley fully. She's wearing her Wellington blazer over a white oxford shirt, the same debate team uniform I've got on. But where my blazer is precisely pressed—because I iron it myself every Sunday night in the dorm laundry room—Riley's is lived-in, comfortable, like she's not worried about looking perfect.

Riley's never had to worry about looking like she belongs here. Her parents are Wellington alumni. She grew up visiting this campus for homecoming weekends and legacy events. The Wellington crest was probably on a blanket in her nursery.

I got here on a scholarship because my parents are public school teachers who saved for three years to cover what financial aid didn't. I remember my mom crying when the acceptance letter came, and my dad making a spreadsheet to figure out how we could afford it even with the scholarship. I remember my first day at Wellington, walking across campus in my carefully-budgeted blazer, watching legacy students greet each other like they'd summered together—because they probably had.

Debate became my armor. My proof that I deserved to be here, that I could compete with students who'd had private tutors and prep school pedigrees. Every tournament I won was validation. Every time I stood at a podium and dismantled an opponent's argument, I was proving that scholarship students could be just as good—better—than anyone else.

"I'm not going to burn anyone out," I say. "I'm going to make sure we're ready."

"Ready for nationals, or ready to beat Oakridge?"

The question lands exactly where she meant it to. I feel my jaw tighten.

"Both," I say.

Riley gives me that knowing look, the one that says she sees right through me. "Jordan. I love you, but your obsession with David Sterling is starting to border on—"

"It's not an obsession," I cut her off. "It's strategy. Oakridge Prep has won nationals three of the last five years. Their team is the strongest in New England. And David Sterling is their captain. If we want to win, we need to be better than them. Better than him."

"Right. Strategy." Riley's tone makes it clear she doesn't entirely believe me, but she lets it drop. "Speaking of which, I saw the prep schedule Oakridge posted on the consortium forums. They're running practices six days a week."

Something cold settles in my stomach. "We're running five."

"I know."

"We could add Saturday mornings."

"Jordan, we're already doing Sunday afternoons. The team needs some downtime."

"Oakridge clearly doesn't think so."

Riley sighs, but she doesn't argue. She knows me well enough to know when I've made up my mind.

The ten-minute break stretches to fifteen as I outline the next drill on the whiteboard, mapping out the argument structure I want them to practice. When everyone's back in position, we run through rebuttals until the light outside starts to fade from late afternoon gold to dusk gray.

By the time I dismiss practice, it's nearly six o'clock. Amanda and the sophomores pack up their materials and head out, discussing dinner plans in the dining hall. Riley lingers, like I knew she would.

"You coming to dinner?" she asks.

"In a bit. I want to review some footage first."

Riley gives me another one of those looks. "Jordan. It's Tuesday. You've been reviewing footage every night this week."

"Because I need to figure out where I'm losing ground."

"You're not losing ground. You're one of the best debaters in the region."

"Second best," I correct. "In New England. And that's not good enough."

For a moment, Riley looks like she wants to say something else. Then she just shakes her head and picks up her bag. "Don't stay too late. You need sleep as much as you need practice."

"I'll be fine."

When she's gone, the practice room falls into the kind of quiet that only comes when you're alone in a building that's usually full of noise. I pull out my laptop and open the folder I've been adding to all semester: *Sterling—Competition Analysis*.

The most recent video is from the regional championship in March. Wellington versus Oakridge Prep in the final round. Me versus David Sterling.

I press play and watch myself take the podium on the left side of the screen. Even through the mediocre camera quality, I can see the tension in my shoulders, the way I grip my notes just a little too tightly. I was nervous. I'd never admit it out loud, but I was nervous. Regionals were supposed to be my proving ground, my chance to show that Wellington Hall—and Jordan Hayes—could beat the best.

On the right side of the screen, David Sterling looks completely at ease. Blazer perfectly fitted, dark hair neatly styled, expression calm and confident. He looks like someone who was born to stand at that podium, like the Sterling name on his name plate is a guarantee rather than a legacy to live up to. His father won nationals. Both his older brothers won nationals. The pressure of that legacy should be crushing, but he wears it like it's nothing.

I've never been able to figure out if that makes me respect him or resent him more.

I watch the round unfold. My opening statement is strong—I know it is. I built my case carefully, every argument supported, every transition clean. But when David delivers his response, I can see exactly where he starts to pull ahead. His cross-examination is surgical. He doesn't just attack my arguments; he finds the microscopic weaknesses in my logical structure and exploits them with precision.

When the judges announce the decision—Oakridge Prep, by three points—I watch myself maintain composure. Shake his hand. Congratulate him with professionalism.

But I remember what I felt in that moment. Not just disappointment. Something sharper, more personal. The feeling that David Sterling saw exactly where I was vulnerable and went straight for it.

The video ends. I sit in the empty practice room, staring at the frozen frame of David Sterling accepting the regional championship trophy, and I make the same promise I've been making since March.

This year at nationals, I'm going to be better. Stronger. Faster. I'm going to anticipate every move before he makes it. I'm going to build arguments so airtight he won't find a single weakness to exploit.

This year at nationals, I'm going to defeat David Sterling on the biggest stage in high school debate.

And I'm going to prove—to the judges, to Wellington Hall, to everyone who's ever questioned whether a scholarship student from a public-school background belongs at an elite prep school—that I deserve to be here.

I close the laptop and pack up my materials. The practice room is dark now except for the glow of the hallway lights spilling through the door. Those championship plaques on the wall catch the light, gleaming with the promise of what could be.

Nationals are six weeks away.

I plan to make every single one of those weeks count.
