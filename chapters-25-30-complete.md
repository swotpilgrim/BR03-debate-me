# Chapter 25: Confessions in Transit

The afternoon drive stretches long, and gradually the van falls into quiet. Younger debaters nap in middle rows, exhausted from nationals and the early morning. Coaches doze in front seats. Even Riley and Marcus have gone silent, both plugged into headphones.

In the back row, David and I are the only ones still awake, watching Pennsylvania landscape pass by outside the windows.

The privacy is unexpected but welcome. With everyone else asleep, we can talk without the whole van listening.

"What are you thinking about?" David asks quietly.

"Senior year ending. Graduation in a few weeks. College starting in the fall." I glance at him. "How everything's changing."

"Scary?"

"A little. Debate has been my identity for four years. Without it, I don't know who I am."

David nods. "I've been thinking the same thing. The Sterling legacy, the family expectations—it's all been tied to high school debate. Once that's over, what defines me?"

"Maybe that's a good thing," I say. "Maybe we both need to figure out who we are without debate as our whole identity."

"What do you think you'll find?"

I consider it. "I don't know. But I think I'm ready to find out."

We're quiet for a while, the hum of highway driving filling the silence. Then David says, "Can I tell you something?"

"Of course."

"Losing to you in finals wouldn't have been the disaster I thought it would be." He's looking at me now. "Actually, part of me wishes you'd won."

"Why?"

"Because then I'd know the hollow feeling was just disappointment. But winning and still feeling empty—that told me something important. That the trophy doesn't matter. The validation I was chasing doesn't exist in championship titles."

"So where does it exist?"

"I think it exists in being seen by someone who actually understands you." He reaches for my hand. "Jordan, debating you this weekend was the best part of nationals. Not because I won, but because you pushed me to be genuinely excellent. You saw every strategy I deployed and met me at every turn. That respect, that intellectual partnership—that matters more than any trophy."

My heart does something complicated. "I feel the same way. Losing to you didn't devastate me because the debate itself was everything I love about competition. Being challenged, being pushed, being respected fully. You gave me that."

"So what do we do with that?" David asks. "With this thing between us that started as rivalry and became something else?"

"We explore it. We see where it goes."

"Even though it's complicated? Different schools, graduation coming, college ahead?"

"Especially because it's complicated." I squeeze his hand. "David, I spent two years knowing exactly what you were to me. My rival, my opponent, the person I needed to beat. That was simple. This is complicated, but it's real."

"I like real better than simple."

"Me too."

The van rolls on through afternoon sunlight. Outside the windows, landscape passes—trees, fields, highway signs counting down miles to Connecticut. Inside, the sleeping team members breathe steadily, unaware of the conversation happening in the back row.

"What happens when we get back?" I ask. "When nationals is over and we're back to regular school life?"

"We make time for each other. We drive the thirty minutes between schools on weekends. We text about things that aren't debate. We figure this out one day at a time."

"You make it sound manageable."

"It is manageable. If we both want it."

"I want it," I say quietly. "I want to know you outside of debate tournaments. I want to see who we are when we're not competing."

"I want that too." David's thumb traces circles on the back of my hand. "Jordan, I know we're going to college in a few months. I know everything's uncertain. But right now, in this moment, I want to try this. I want to see what we could be."

"Then let's try."

The van crosses into Connecticut, familiar landscape replacing Pennsylvania hills. We're getting close now—another hour until Wellington, then Oakridge after that. The road trip is ending, nationals is officially over, and real life is waiting.

But sitting here with David's hand in mine, watching the world pass by outside, I feel ready. Ready for whatever comes next. Ready to figure out who we are to each other. Ready to explore this thing that started with competition and became something infinitely more complicated and more worthwhile.

"I'm going to miss this," David says.

"The van?"

"The proximity. Having you right here where I can talk to you without planning or driving thirty minutes."

"We'll make it work. We're both strategic thinkers. We can figure out logistics."

He laughs. "Only we would approach a relationship like a debate strategy problem."

"It's who we are."

"Yeah. It is." He looks at me with something soft in his expression. "And I like who we are."

The miles pass. Connecticut landscape becomes more familiar—approaching home territory now. In the middle rows, Riley starts to wake up, stretching and yawning. Marcus pulls out his headphones. The coaches stir in front seats.

The quiet privacy of the back row is ending, but what it gave us remains. Understanding. Connection. The beginning of something new.

David and I let go of each other's hands as the van becomes active again, but the warmth lingers. We're both smiling slightly, both processing what just happened, both ready for whatever comes next.

The van exits the highway. Wellington's campus appears in the distance.

The journey home is almost over. But the real journey—figuring out who we are together—is just beginning.

---

# Chapter 26: Rest Stop Revelation

The van stops at a rest area in Delaware for dinner and gas as the sun begins to set. Teams scatter toward the food court and bathrooms, grateful for the break from sitting.

I grab my jacket and head outside for fresh air instead of immediately following everyone inside. The spring evening is perfect—warm but not hot, a light breeze carrying the smell of new growth. The parking lot is half-full of travelers, and beyond I can see hints of sunset coloring the horizon.

I'm standing by the van, watching the sky change colors, when David finds me.

"Thought you might be out here," he says.

"Needed a minute. Needed to think."

He leans against the van beside me. "About?"

"About tomorrow. When this is all over and we go back to being regular students at separate schools." I turn to look at him. "About whether this thing between us can survive reality."

"Are you having doubts?"

"Not doubts. Just... awareness of how complicated this is."

David is quiet for a moment, watching the sunset. Then he says, "Can I tell you something I've been thinking about?"

"Always."

"Debating you has been the best part of my high school career. Not because of wins or losses or tournament results. Because you're the only person who's ever challenged me to genuine excellence rather than just maintaining family appearances."

"David—"

"Let me finish." He turns to face me fully. "You're the only opponent who ever respected my capabilities without being intimidated by the Sterling name. You argued with me, pushed back against my strategies, forced me to be actually good instead of just performing goodness. You saw me. Not my family legacy, not my prep school image—me."

My breath catches. "I did see you. I see you."

"And I see you. The scholarship student who fought for every achievement, who refuses to be dismissed, who competes with passion because every round matters personally." He steps closer. "Jordan, you're brilliant and fierce and you made me better by refusing to let me be anything less than my best. That's not something I can walk away from when nationals ends."

"So what are you saying?"

"I'm saying that this trip made me realize I don't just respect you as an opponent. I—" He stops, seeming to gather courage. "I'm falling for you. Actually falling, not just intellectual attraction or respect or any other safe label. Real feelings that have nothing to do with debate and everything to do with who you are."

The words hit me with unexpected force. I knew David had feelings—he told me as much earlier. But hearing him say he's falling for me, out loud, with conviction—that's different.

"I'm falling for you too," I say quietly. "And it terrifies me because I don't know how to be that vulnerable with someone who's seen me at my most competitive."

"Maybe that's exactly why it works. Because we've both seen each other at our most intense, most driven, most protective of our capabilities. And we still want this."

He's right. David has seen me argue fiercely, defend my positions ruthlessly, compete with everything I have. He's seen me lose and struggle and refuse to give up. And he's falling for me anyway—not despite those things, but including them.

"What happens when we get back?" I ask. "How do we make this work with different schools and graduation coming and college in the fall?"

"We try. We make plans to see each other. We drive the thirty minutes between Wellington and Oakridge on weekends. We text and call and figure out how to be together even when logistics are complicated." He reaches for my hand. "Jordan, I don't have all the answers. I just know I don't want the road trip to be the end of us."

"Me neither."

We're standing close now in the parking lot, sunset painting everything gold and orange behind us. Around us, the rest stop continues—travelers coming and going, our teams inside getting food, the world moving forward. But in this moment, it's just David and me, both finally admitting what's been building since that first van ride.

"Can I ask you something?" David says.

"Anything."

"If I wanted to drive to Wellington next weekend and take you to dinner—not a debate-related meal, not a team thing, just you and me getting to know each other—would you say yes?"

My heart races. "Are you asking me on a date, David Sterling?"

"I'm absolutely asking you on a date."

"Then yes. I would say yes."

His smile is genuine, unguarded, transforming his usually composed expression into something open and hopeful. "Good. Great. I'll text you and we'll figure out logistics."

"Very romantic. Debaters discussing logistics."

"We're debaters. It's what we do."

I laugh despite myself. "You're ridiculous."

"You're falling for me anyway."

"Unfortunately true."

We stand there a moment longer, both smiling, both aware we've crossed some threshold that changes everything. Tomorrow we return to regular life, but regular life now includes this—whatever we're calling it. This thing that started with rivalry and became something neither of us expected.

"We should probably head inside," David says. "Our teams are going to wonder where we are."

"Let them wonder."

But we start walking toward the rest stop entrance anyway, hands almost touching but not quite holding—we're not ready to be that obvious yet, not ready for the inevitable teasing from Riley and Marcus.

At the door, David stops. "Jordan?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for being the kind of person I could fall for. And for being willing to try this even when it's complicated."

"Thank you for seeing me. For all of it."

We head inside to find our teams, and everything's different now. Not because we have labels or definitions or certainty about the future.

But because we both decided that whatever this is between us—this rivalry-turned-understanding-turned-something-more—is worth exploring. Worth the risk. Worth the complication.

And that's enough.

---

# Chapter 27: The Kiss

The van reaches the overnight hotel in New Jersey around 9 PM. Both teams are exhausted from the long day of driving, and check-in is efficient—everyone just wants to get to rooms and sleep.

I'm sharing with Riley and Amanda again. After we unpack and change into comfortable clothes, Amanda immediately crashes, asleep before her head hits the pillow. Riley looks at me knowingly.

"You're not going to sleep, are you?"

"Probably not."

"You're going to text David and see if he's awake."

"Maybe."

"Jordan." Riley sits on her bed, facing me. "Go. Go find him. Talk to him. Do whatever you need to do. Just stop pretending you're fine with going to bed early when you're clearly thinking about him."

"Am I that obvious?"

"You've been obvious since the rest stop in Delaware where you both disappeared for twenty minutes." She grins. "Go. I'll cover for you if Amanda wakes up."

"Thank you."

"Just don't do anything that violates the clean content rating of this story."

"Riley!"

"I'm just saying. Keep it PG."

I grab my room key and phone, pull a hoodie over my t-shirt, and slip out into the hallway. It's almost 11 PM, and the hotel is quiet—most teams already asleep or close to it.

I head down to the lobby, thinking I'll text David from there, maybe suggest we talk for a bit if he's awake. But when I reach the lobby, he's already there, sitting in a corner armchair with his phone in hand.

He looks up when I appear, and his expression shifts to something warm. "I was hoping you'd come down."

"How did you know I would?"

"Because I couldn't sleep thinking about you, and I figured you might feel the same."

I sit in the chair beside his. The lobby is nearly empty—just a tired desk clerk and one late-arriving family checking in.

"Tomorrow we go back to Connecticut," I say.

"Tomorrow everything changes again."

"David, I need to know this is real. That when we're back at our schools and nationals is over, you're not going to disappear or decide this was just a tournament thing."

He sets his phone down and turns to face me fully. "Jordan. Look at me."

I do.

"This is real," he says. "What I feel for you is real. It's not about nationals or proximity or being caught up in competition. It's about you—who you are, how you challenge me, how you make me better. That doesn't disappear when we get back to Connecticut."

"How do you know?"

"Because I've been falling for you since you argued with me about van snacks at that first rest stop, and nationals is almost over and I'm still falling."

My breath catches. "That was only a week ago."

"A week of proximity and conversation and getting to know you as Jordan, not just my debate opponent." He reaches for my hand. "A week of realizing that the person I've been obsessed with beating is actually the person I want beside me."

"I want that too."

"Then let's do this. Actually commit to trying this, to seeing where it goes, to making time for each other even when it's complicated."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yes. Okay. I want to try this with you."

David's smile is beautiful, unguarded in a way I've rarely seen. And then he says, "Can I kiss you?"

My heart stops. Restarts. Races.

"Yes."

He leans forward, and I meet him halfway. The kiss is tentative at first—we're both nervous, both aware this is crossing a line from which there's no going back. But then his hand comes up to cup my cheek, and I lean into him, and the kiss deepens slightly.

It's perfect. Gentle, sweet, full of promise. Everything a first kiss should be.

When we pull apart, we're both a little breathless, both smiling.

"Wow," David says.

"Yeah. Wow."

We sit close together in the quiet lobby, foreheads almost touching, both processing what just happened.

"We should probably go back to our rooms," I say eventually. "Before our teams send out search parties."

"Probably." But neither of us moves.

"David?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm really glad it was you. In finals, on the road trip, all of it. I'm glad my rival was you."

"Past tense? Was?"

"Is. My rival is you. Present tense. Just... in a different way now."

"I like this kind of rivalry better."

"Me too."

We stand, both reluctant to end this moment. At the elevator, we pause.

"Text me when you get back to your room?" David asks.

"I will."

"And Jordan? Sweet dreams."

I watch the elevator carry him up to the sixth floor, then take the next one to the fifth. When I slip back into my room, Riley is still awake, waiting.

"Well?" she whispers.

"We kissed."

"FINALLY." Then quieter when Amanda stirs: "I mean, finally. Took you long enough."

I climb into bed, smiling, and pull out my phone. There's already a text from David: *Made it back. Already missing you.*

I text back: *Same. See you tomorrow.*

As I finally drift toward sleep, I'm still smiling. Tomorrow we return to Connecticut, to separate schools, to regular life. But regular life now includes David Sterling—not as my opponent, but as something infinitely better.

As the person I'm falling for.

---

# Chapter 28: The Final Morning

The last morning of the road trip dawns with a bittersweet feeling. I wake to Riley shaking my shoulder and daylight streaming through the hotel curtains.

"Final day," she says. "Last van ride. Then back to real life."

We meet both teams for breakfast before the final three-hour drive home. The hotel restaurant is busy with teams from various tournaments, everyone preparing for checkout and travel. I spot David at a table with Marcus and smile when our eyes meet.

Riley sees the exchange and elbows me. "You two are being obvious."

"Let us be obvious. We have like three more hours before this trip ends."

After breakfast, both teams pack up and meet at the van for the last time. The loading is efficient now—everyone knows their role, belongings organized, the routine familiar after a week of travel.

I end up in the back row with David again. No one comments on it anymore. Riley and Marcus exchange knowing looks but say nothing. Even the coaches seem aware something shifted, though they're professional enough not to mention it.

The van pulls out of the hotel parking lot, heading north toward Connecticut. Final leg of the journey. Last few hours before nationals is officially, completely over.

"What are you going to do when you get back?" David asks quietly.

"Unpack. Sleep. Face the reality of finals week and graduation coming." I glance at him. "Text you approximately five minutes after the van drops me at Wellington."

"I was hoping you'd say that."

The drive passes with mixed conversation and comfortable silence. Teams reflect on nationals, discuss favorite moments, make plans to stay in touch. Coach Brennan and Professor Caldwell talk about next year's season, even though many of us are graduating.

As the van crosses into Connecticut, the mood shifts slightly. Home territory now. The trip really is ending.

Riley turns around in her seat to face me. "So. You and David Sterling."

"Me and David Sterling."

"Going to keep seeing each other?"

"We're going to try."

"Good." She grins. "You make more sense together than anyone would have predicted two weeks ago."

Marcus overhears and joins in. "I predicted it. I told David from the first van ride that his obsession with Jordan was suspicious."

"It was not an obsession," David protests. "It was strategic rivalry analysis."

"Sure it was."

The teasing is good-natured, and both David and I handle it better than we would have a week ago. Because now we know what this is. We know where we stand. And the teasing doesn't matter when you're sure of what you have.

The van exits toward Wellington. We're twenty minutes from campus now.

"Final thoughts on nationals?" Coach Brennan asks the Wellington team.

"Best tournament of my career," I say honestly. "Not because of results, but because of the competition level and what I learned."

"You should all be proud," Coach Brennan says. "Second place at nationals with the closest finals in tournament history—that's an achievement worth celebrating."

The van pulls into Wellington's familiar parking lot. We're here. The trip is over.

Both teams climb out, stretching legs after long hours sitting. Duffel bags are unloaded one last time, debate cases retrieved from storage. The van empties.

Oakridge will leave from here, driving the final thirty minutes to their campus. This is where we say goodbye.

Marcus appears at David's side. "We should head out. Got to get this trophy back to school before Professor Caldwell turns into a pumpkin."

David nods but looks at me. "Can we talk? Just for a minute?"

"Of course."

We walk a short distance from the teams, finding relative privacy by Wellington's athletic fields. From here, we can see the campus I've called home for four years, and in the distance, the van that will carry David back to Oakridge.

"So," he says.

"So." I try to smile. "Back to normal life."

"With some modifications."

"Right. Modifications like dating my former rival."

"Current rival. We're always going to push each other. Just in different ways now." He takes my hand. "Jordan, I meant what I said. All of it. I'm not disappearing when this van leaves."

"I know. And I'm not either."

"Next weekend. Dinner at that place halfway between our schools. The one Riley mentioned."

"It's a date."

"Our second date, technically. Since breakfast yesterday was our first."

"Who's counting?"

"I am. Because I want to remember all of them."

The sentiment is so genuine, so David, that I have to smile. "You're kind of perfect, you know that?"

"I'm really not. But I'm perfect for you, maybe."

"Maybe."

From the parking lot, Marcus calls that they need to leave. Time's up.

David squeezes my hand. "I'll text you tonight. We'll make plans. Figure out logistics."

"Always with the logistics."

"It's how we work."

He hesitates, glancing back at the teams, then leans in and kisses me quickly. It's brief, chaste, but meaningful. A promise.

"See you soon," he says.

"See you soon."

I watch the van pull away, David visible through the back window. He waves, and I wave back, and then they're gone, heading toward Oakridge.

Riley appears at my side as the van disappears.

"You good?"

"Yeah. I'm good." And I am. Because this isn't an ending.

It's a beginning.

---

# Chapter 29: Moving Forward

One week later, I'm standing outside Wellington's main gates waiting for David to pick me up for our second official date. It's Saturday afternoon, spring weather perfect, and I'm wearing jeans and a casual shirt—normal clothes, not debate formal attire.

A car pulls up—David's car, which I recognize from tournament parking lots. He gets out, and he's in jeans and a t-shirt too, looking more relaxed than I've ever seen him at tournaments.

"Hi," he says.

"Hi."

We stand there for a second, both suddenly awkward now that we're not surrounded by teams or trapped in vans. This is real life dating, actual intentional time together, and somehow that's more nerve-wracking than nationals.

"So," David says. "Lunch?"

"Lunch sounds perfect."

We drive to the restaurant Riley recommended, halfway between Wellington and Oakridge. It's a casual café popular with students from both schools, apparently neutral territory for us.

Over sandwiches and coffee, we talk. Really talk, about things that have nothing to do with debate.

"How's finals week going?" David asks.

"Stressful. You?"

"Same. Plus everyone at Oakridge wants to hear about nationals and see the trophy." He grimaces. "It's a lot of attention."

"How does that feel? Now that you've had a week to process?"

He's quiet for a moment. "Honestly? The trophy matters less than I thought it would. What matters is that I competed well, that I earned it fairly, and that—" He looks at me. "That the debate itself was worth more than the result."

"Because of who you debated against?"

"Exactly because of who I debated against."

I reach across the table and take his hand. "I feel the same way. Losing doesn't bother me the way I thought it would. The round was too good for the result to matter that much."

"So what does matter?"

"This. Sitting here with you, figuring out who we are outside debate. Getting to know you as David, not David Sterling, champion debater."

"What have you learned so far?"

I pretend to think about it. "That you're kind of nerdy about strategic thinking even outside debate. That you genuinely care about people but hide it behind composed facades. That you're funny when you let yourself be. That you're worth the thirty-minute drive between schools."

He smiles. "What do you want me to know about you? The non-debate version of Jordan?"

"That I'm still figuring out who that is. That debate has been my identity for so long, I'm discovering there's more to me than competition. That I'm scared about college and the future but also excited." I pause. "And that falling for you was completely unexpected and completely right."

"I'm falling for you too. Present continuous tense. Ongoing action."

"Grammar nerd."

"Debate nerd."

"We're both hopeless."

After lunch, we walk through the small downtown area near the restaurant. It's the kind of casual date that shouldn't feel significant but does, because it's us choosing to be together without tournaments or teams or any other reason except wanting to.

"What happens in the fall?" I ask as we walk. "When college starts?"

"We figure it out. Where are you going again?"

"Boston University. You?"

"Yale. So we'll be what, two hours apart?"

"Manageable."

"Definitely manageable." He takes my hand as we walk. "Jordan, I know we're both going to college in a few months. I know everything's uncertain. But I want to try this. Actually try, not just say we'll stay in touch and then drift apart."

"Me too. I want to see where this goes."

"Even if it's complicated?"

"Especially if it's complicated. We're both strategic thinkers. We can handle complicated."

We end up sitting on a bench in a small park, talking about college plans and summer before freshman year and all the uncertainty ahead. But underneath the uncertainty is something solid—this thing between us that started with rivalry and became understanding and is growing into something neither of us wants to let go of.

"Can I tell you something?" David says.

"Always."

"Meeting you—really getting to know you during that road trip—it changed how I think about competition. About achievement. About what matters." He turns to face me. "You showed me that having someone who challenges you and respects you fully is worth more than any trophy. That partnership matters more than victory."

"You showed me the same thing. That losing to the right person can matter more than winning against anyone else."

We sit in comfortable silence for a while, both processing how much has changed in two weeks. Two weeks ago, we were rivals headed to nationals. Now we're something completely different, something still being defined, something with potential.

"I should get you back to Wellington," David says eventually. "Before Coach Brennan sends out search parties."

"Probably wise."

He drives me back to campus, and we sit in his car for a few minutes in the parking lot, neither wanting the date to end.

"Same time next weekend?" David asks.

"Absolutely."

"And I'll text you this week. Daily. Maybe hourly."

"I'm counting on it."

He leans across and kisses me, and it's sweet and certain and full of promise.

When I walk back to my dorm, I'm smiling. Riley is waiting in our room with a thousand questions, and I answer them all honestly.

Yes, the date was perfect. Yes, we're seeing each other again next weekend. Yes, I'm falling for him. Yes, I think this might actually work.

Because we're both willing to try. And that's everything.

---

# Chapter 30: Partnership

Two weeks later, finals are over, graduation is approaching, and I'm sitting in Wellington's library supposedly studying for last exams when my phone buzzes.

David: *Outside. Can you take a break?*

I pack up my laptop and head to the campus entrance. David is leaning against his car, and when he sees me, he smiles.

"Study break delivery service," he says, holding up a coffee cup.

"You drove thirty minutes to bring me coffee?"

"I drove thirty minutes because I wanted to see you and coffee was a good excuse."

I take the coffee and kiss him. "Thank you."

We walk to a bench overlooking Wellington's athletic fields. It's a beautiful spring afternoon, the kind of day that makes you grateful for New England weather when it cooperates.

"How are finals going?" David asks.

"Fine. Stressful but manageable." I sip the coffee. "How about you?"

"Same. And dealing with college preparation and moving plans and all the summer-before-freshman-year logistics."

"It's a lot."

"It is." He's quiet for a moment. "Jordan, can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"What happens to us? This summer, when we're both home but not at school. This fall, when we're at different colleges. How do we make this work?"

I've been thinking about the same question. "We're intentional. We make plans to see each other. We communicate. We figure it out as we go."

"That's not a very specific strategy."

"No. But it's honest." I turn to face him. "David, I can't predict the future. I don't know if we'll make it through college or if distance will be too hard or if we'll change too much as we grow up. But I know I want to try. I know that what we have is worth fighting for."

"What do we have?"

I think about it. "We have partnership. Mutual respect. Someone who challenges us to be better while accepting who we already are. We have understanding and attraction and genuine affection. We have a relationship that started with competition and became something infinitely better."

"Partnership," David repeats. "I like that."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Because that's what we've always been, even when we were rivals. We pushed each other, matched each other, made each other better. That doesn't change just because we're dating now."

"No, it doesn't." I lean into him. "You're still going to challenge me and argue with me and push me to think harder."

"And you're still going to call me on my assumptions and refuse to let me take the easy path and make me actually earn my positions."

"Exactly."

"So we're competitive partners."

"Best kind of partners."

We sit quietly for a while, comfortable in each other's presence. Around us, campus continues—students studying, teams practicing, the end-of-year energy building toward graduation.

"I'm going to miss this," David says. "Wellington and Oakridge debate circuits. The tournaments. The routine of it all."

"Me too. But I'm excited for what comes next."

"College debate?"

"That. And college in general. New experiences. Growing up. Figuring out who we are beyond high school." I glance at him. "Doing all of it with you."

"Even though I'll be at Yale and you'll be at BU?"

"Even though. Two hours isn't impossible. We can visit on weekends, meet halfway, make it work."

"What if it gets too hard? What if the distance is too much?"

"Then we deal with that if it happens. But I don't want to preemptively give up on us because of logistics."

David smiles. "You're right. We're both strategic thinkers. We can handle logistics."

"Exactly."

His phone buzzes with a reminder. "I should head back. Promised Professor Caldwell I'd help with end-of-year tournament organization."

"And I should get back to studying."

We stand, and David pulls me into a hug. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being the kind of opponent who made me better. For being the kind of person I could fall for. For being willing to try this even when it's uncertain."

"Thank you for the same thing." I pull back to look at him. "David, whatever happens next—college, career, life—I'm glad my rival was you. I'm glad the person who challenged me most became the person I care about most."

"Partnership."

"Partnership," I agree.

He kisses me, sweet and certain, and then heads back to his car. I watch him drive away, then return to the library and my studying.

But I'm smiling. Because losing nationals gave me something better than a trophy.

It gave me David Sterling. Not as my rival, but as my partner. Someone who sees my capabilities and respects them. Someone who challenges me to be better while accepting who I am. Someone who started as my fiercest opponent and became my closest ally.

And that? That's worth more than any championship.

I open my laptop and get back to work, but my phone is beside me, already showing a text from David: *Already missing you. Can't wait for next weekend.*

I text back: *Same. Now go help Professor Caldwell so you can come back sooner.*

His response is immediate: *Competitive even about how fast I finish tasks. This is why we work.*

I laugh and put my phone away, focusing on my studies. But the smile stays.

Because he's right. This is why we work. Challenge and support, competition and partnership, pushing each other while standing beside each other.
